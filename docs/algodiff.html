<h1>Algorithmic Differentiation</h1>
<p>TBD</p>
<section class="level2" id="introduction">
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In science and engineering it is often necessary to study the relationship between two or more quantities, where change of one quantity leads to change of others. For example, in describing the motion an object, we describe velocity <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> of an object with the change of the distance regarding time:</p>
<p><span id="eq:algodiff:def"><span class="math display">\[v = \lim_{\Delta~t}\frac{\Delta~s}{\Delta~t} = \frac{ds}{dt}.\qquad(1)\]</span></span></p>
<p>This relationship <span class="math inline">\(\frac{ds}{dt}\)</span> can be called “<em>derivative</em> of <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> with respect to <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>”. This process can be extended to higher dimensional space. For example, think about a solid block of material, placed in a cartesian axis system. You heat it at some part of it and cool it down at some other place, and you can imagine that the temperature <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> at different position of this block: <span class="math inline">\(T(x, y, z)\)</span>. In this field, we can describe this change with partial derivatives along each axis:</p>
<p><span id="eq:algodiff:grad"><span class="math display">\[\nabla~T = (\frac{\partial~T}{\partial~x}, \frac{\partial~T}{\partial~y}, \frac{\partial~T}{\partial~z}).\qquad(2)\]</span></span></p>
<p>Here, the call the vector <span class="math inline">\(\nabla~T\)</span> <em>gradient</em> of <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>. The procedure to calculating derivatives and gradients is called <em>differentiating</em>.</p>
<p>Differentiation is crucial in many scientific related fields: find maximum or minimum values using gradient descent (see later chapter); ODE (see later chapter); Non-linear optimisation such as KKT optimality conditions is still a prime application. One new crucial application is in machine learning.</p>
<p>TODO: detail description of application.</p>
<section class="level3" id="chain-rule">
<h3>Chain Rule</h3>
<p>Before diving into how to do differentiation on computers, let’s recall how to do it manually from our Calculus 101.</p>
<p>One of the most rule in performing differentiation is the <em>chain rule</em>. In calculus, the chain rule is a formula to compute the derivative of a composite function. Suppose we have two functions <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span>, then the Chain rule states that:</p>
<p><span id="eq:algodiff:chainrule01"><span class="math display">\[F'(x)=f'(g(x))g'(x).\qquad(3)\]</span></span></p>
<p>This seemingly simple rule is one of the basic rule in calculating derivatives. For example, let <span class="math inline">\(y = x^a\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> is a real number, and then we can get <span class="math inline">\(y'\)</span> using the chain rule. Specifically, let <span class="math inline">\(y=e^{ln~x^a} = e^{a~ln~x}\)</span>, and then we can set <span class="math inline">\(u= alnx\)</span> so that now <span class="math inline">\(y=e^u\)</span>. By applying the chain rule, we have:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[y' = \frac{dy}{du}~\frac{du}{dx} = e^u~a~\frac{1}{x} = ax^{a-1}.\]</span></p>
<p>Besides the chain rule, it’s helpful to remember some basic differentiation equations, as shown in tbl.&nbsp;1. Here <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is variable and both <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> are functions with regard to <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>. <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> is constant. Of course, this very short list is incomplete. Please refer to calculus textbooks for more information. Armed with chain rule and these basic equations, wen can begin to solve more differentiation problem than you can imagine.</p>

<h3>Differentiation Methods</h3>
<p>As the models and algorithms become increasingly complex, sometimes the function being implicit, it is impractical to perform manual differentiation. Therefore, we turn to computer-based automated computation methods. There are three: numerical differentiation, symbolic differentiation, and algorithmic differentiation.</p>
<p><strong>Numerical Differentiation</strong></p>
<p>The numerical differentiation comes from the definition of derivative in eq.&nbsp;1. It uses a small step <span class="math inline">\(\delta\)</span> to approximate the limit in the definition:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[f'(x) = \lim_{\delta~\to~0}\frac{f(x+\delta) - f(x)}{\delta}.\]</span></p>
<p>As long as you knows how to evaluate function <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>, this method can be applied, and coding this method is also straightforward. However, the problem with this method is prone to truncation errors and round-off errors. The truncation errors is introduced by truncating an infinite sum and approximating it by a finite sum; the round-off error is then caused by representing numbers approximately in numerical computation during this process. Besides, this method is also slow due to requiring multiple evaluation of function <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>. We’ll discuss it later in the optimisation chapter, since optimisation using gradient is a very important application of differentiation. Some discussion about numerically solving derivative related problems is also covered in the Ordinary Differentiation Equation chapter, where we focus on introducing solving these equations numerically, and how the impact of these errors can be reduced.</p>
<p><strong>Symbolic Differentiation</strong></p>
<p>Symbolic Differentiation is the opposite of numerical solution. It does not involve numerical computation, only math symbol manipulation. The rules we have introduced in tbl.&nbsp;1 are actually expressed in symbols. Think about this function: <span class="math inline">\(f(x_0, x_1, x_2) = x_0 * x_1 * x_2\)</span>. If we compute <span class="math inline">\(\nabla~f\)</span> symbolically, we end up with:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\nabla~f = (\frac{\partial~f}{\partial~x_0}, \frac{\partial~f}{\partial~x_1}, \frac{\partial~f}{\partial~x_2}) = (x_1 * x_2, x_0 * x_2, x_1 * x_2).\]</span></p>
<p>It is nice and accurate, leaving limited space for numerical errors. However, you can try to extend the number of variables from 3 to a large number <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, which means <span class="math inline">\(f(x) = \prod_{i=0}^{n-1}x_i\)</span>, and then try to perform the symbolic differentiation again.</p>
<p>The point is that, symbolic computations tends to give a very large result for even not very complex functions. It’s easy to have duplicated common sub computations, and produce exponentially large symbolic expressions. Therefore, as intuitive as it is, the symbolic differentiation method can easily takes a lot of memory in computer, and is slow.</p>
<p><strong>Algorithmic Differentiation</strong></p>
<p>Algorithmic differentiation (AD) is a chain-rule based technique for calculating the derivatives with regards to input variables of functions defined in a computer programme. It is also known as automatic differentiation, though strictly speaking AD does not fully automate differentiation and can lead to inefficient code.</p>
<p>It is important to realise that AD is not symbolic differentiation, as we will see in the next section. Even though AD also follows the chain rule, it directly applies numerical computation for intermediate results. Therefore, AD can generate exact results with acceptable speed and memory usage, and therefore highly applicable in various real world applications. Actually, according to <span data-cites="griewank1989automatic" class="citation">(Griewank and others 1989)</span>, the reverse mode of AD yields any gradient vector at no more than five times the cost of evaluating the function <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> itself. AD has already been implemented in various popular languages, including the <a href="https://pythonhosted.org/ad/"><code>ad</code></a> in Python, <a href="https://www.juliadiff.org/"><code>JuliaDiff</code></a> in Julia, and <a href="http://www.cayugaresearch.com/admat.html"><code>ADMAT</code></a> in MATLAB, etc. In the rest of this chapter, we focus on introducing the AD module in Owl.</p>

<h2>How Algorithmic Differentiation Works</h2>
<p>We have seen the chain rules being applied on simple functions such as <span class="math inline">\(y=x^a\)</span>. Now let’s check how this rule can be applied on more complex computations. Let’s look at the function below:</p>
<p><span id="eq:algodiff:example"><span class="math display">\[y(x_0, x_1) = (1 + e^{x_0~x_1 + sin(x_0)})^{-1}.\qquad(4)\]</span></span></p>
<p>This functions is based on a sigmoid function. Our goal is to compute the partial derivative <span class="math inline">\(\frac{\partial~y}{\partial~x_0}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\frac{\partial~y}{\partial~x_1}\)</span>. To better illustrate this process, we express eq.&nbsp;4 as a graph, as shown in fig.&nbsp;1. At the right side of the figure, we have the final output <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, and at the roots of this graph are input variables. The nodes between them indicate constants or intermediate variables that are gotten via basic functions such as <code>sine</code>. All nodes are labelled by <span class="math inline">\(v_i\)</span>. An edge between two nodes represents an explicit dependency in the computation.</p>
<figure>
<img alt="" style="width:100.0%" id="fig:algodiff:example_01" title="example_01" src="images/algodiff/example_01.png"><figcaption>Figure 1: Graph expression of function</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Based on this graphic representation, there are two major ways to apply the chain rules: the forward differentiation mode, and the reverse differentiation mode (not “backward differentiation”, which is a method used for solving ordinary differential equations). Next, we introduce these two methods.</p>
<section class="level3" id="forward-mode">
<h3>Forward Mode</h3>
<p>Our target is to calculate <span class="math inline">\(\frac{\partial~y}{\partial~x_0}\)</span> (partial derivative regarding <span class="math inline">\(x_1\)</span> should be similar). But don’t be so hurry, let’s start with some earlier intermediate results that might be helpful. For example, what is <span class="math inline">\(\frac{\partial~x_0}{\partial~x_1}\)</span>? 1, obviously. Equally obvious is <span class="math inline">\(\frac{\partial~x_1}{\partial~x_1} = 0\)</span>. It’s just elementary. Now, things gets a bit trickier: what is <span class="math inline">\(\frac{\partial~v_3}{\partial~x_0}\)</span>? Not is a good time to use the chain rule:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\frac{\partial~v_3}{\partial~x_0} = \frac{\partial~(x_0~x_1)}{\partial~x_0} = x_1~\frac{\partial~(x_0)}{\partial~x_0} + x_0~\frac{\partial~(x_1)}{\partial~x_0} = x_1.\]</span></p>
<p>After calculating <span class="math inline">\(\frac{\partial~v_3}{\partial~x_0}\)</span>, we can then processed with derivatives of <span class="math inline">\(v_5\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(v_6\)</span>, all the way to that of <span class="math inline">\(v_9\)</span> which is also the output <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> we are looking for. This process starts with the input variables, and ends with output variables. Therefore, it is called <em>forward differentiation</em>. We can do simplify the math notations in this process by letting <span class="math inline">\(\dot{v_i}=\frac{\partial~(v_i)}{\partial~x_0}\)</span>. The <span class="math inline">\(\dot{v_i}\)</span> here is called <em>tangent</em> of function <span class="math inline">\(v_i(x_0, x_1, \ldots, x_n)\)</span> with regard to input variable <span class="math inline">\(x_0\)</span>, and the original computation results at each intermediate point is called <em>primal</em> values. The forward differentiation mode is sometimes also called “tangent linear” mode.</p>
<p>Now we can present the full forward differentiation calculation process, as shown in tbl.&nbsp;2. Two simultaneous lines of computing happen: on the left hand side is the computation procedure specified by eq.&nbsp;4; on the right side shows computation of derivative for each intermediate variable with regard to <span class="math inline">\(x_0\)</span>. Let’s find out <span class="math inline">\(\dot{y}\)</span> when setting <span class="math inline">\(x_0 = 1\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(x_1 = 1\)</span>.</p>

<h3>Reverse Mode</h3>
<p>Now let’s think this problem from the other direction, literally. The same questions: to calculate <span class="math inline">\(\frac{\partial~y}{\partial~x_0}\)</span>. We still follow the same “step by step” idea from the forward mode, but the difference is that, we think it backward. For example, here we reduce the problem in this way: since in this graph <span class="math inline">\(y = v_7 / v_8\)</span>, if only we can have <span class="math inline">\(\frac{\partial~y}{\partial~v_7}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\frac{\partial~y}{\partial~v_8}\)</span>, then this problem should be one step closer towards my target problem.</p>
<p>First of course, we have <span class="math inline">\(\frac{\partial~y}{\partial~v_9} = 1\)</span>, since <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(v_9\)</span> are the same. Then how do we get <span class="math inline">\(\frac{\partial~y}{\partial~v_7}\)</span>? Again, time for chain rule:</p>
<p><span id="eq:algodiff:reverse_01"><span class="math display">\[\frac{\partial~y}{\partial~v_7} = \frac{\partial~y}{\partial~v_9} * \frac{\partial~v_9}{\partial~v_7} = 1 * \frac{\partial~v_9}{\partial~v_7} = \frac{\partial~(v_7 / v_8)}{\partial~v_7} = \frac{1}{v_8}.\qquad(5)\]</span></span></p>
<p>Hmm, let’s try to apply a notation to simplify this process. Let</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\bar{v_i} = \frac{\partial~y}{\partial~v_i}\]</span></p>
<p>be the derivative of output variable <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> with regard to intermediate node <span class="math inline">\(v_i\)</span>. It is called the <em>adjoint</em> of variable <span class="math inline">\(v_i\)</span> with respect to the output variable <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>. Using this notation, eq.&nbsp;5 can be expressed as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\bar{v_7} = \bar{v_9} * \frac{\partial~v_9}{\partial~v_7} = 1 * \frac{1}{v_8}.\]</span></p>
<p>Note the difference between tangent and adjoint. In the forward mode, we know <span class="math inline">\(\dot{v_0}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\dot{v_1}\)</span>, then we calculate <span class="math inline">\(\dot{v_2}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\dot{v3}\)</span>, …. and then finally we have <span class="math inline">\(\dot{v_9}\)</span>, which is the target. Here, we start with knowing <span class="math inline">\(\bar{v_9} = 1\)</span>, and then we calculate <span class="math inline">\(\bar{v_8}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\bar{v_7}\)</span>, …. and then finally we have <span class="math inline">\(\bar{v_0} = \frac{\partial~y}{\partial~v_0} = \frac{\partial~y}{\partial~x_0}\)</span>, which is also exactly our target. Again, <span class="math inline">\(\dot{v_9} = \bar{v_0}\)</span> in this example, given that we are talking about derivative regarding <span class="math inline">\(x_0\)</span> when we use <span class="math inline">\(\dot{v_9}\)</span>. Following this line of calculation, the reverse differentiation mode is also called <em>adjoint mode</em>.</p>
<p>With that in mind, let’s see the full steps of performing reverse differentiation. First, we need to perform a forward pass to compute the required intermediate values, as shown in tbl.&nbsp;3.</p>

<p>You might be wondering, this looks the same as the left side of tbl.&nbsp;2. You are right. These two are exactly the same, and we repeat it again to make the point that, this time you cannot perform the calculation with one pass. You must compute the required intermediate results first, and then perform the other “backward pass”, which is the key point in reverse mode.</p>

<h3>Forward or Reverse?</h3>
<p>Since both can be used to differentiate a function then the natural question is which mode we should choose in practice. The short answer is: it depends on your function.</p>
<p>In general, given a function that you want to differentiate, the rule of thumb is:</p>
<ul>
<li>if input variables &gt;&gt; output variables, then use reverse mode;</li>
<li>if input variables &lt;&lt; output variables, then use forward mode.</li>
</ul>
<p>Later we will show example of this point.</p>
<p>For each input variable, we need to seed individual variable and perform one forward pass. The number of forward passes increase linearly as the number of inputs increases. However, for backward mode, no matter how many inputs there are, one backward pass can give us all the derivatives of the inputs. I guess now you understand why we need to use backward mode for <code>f</code>. One real-world example of <code>f</code> is machine learning and neural network algorithms, wherein there are many inputs but the output is often one scalar value from loss function.</p>
<p>Backward mode needs to maintain a directed computation graph in the memory so that the errors can propagate back; whereas the forward mode does not have to do that due to the algebra of dual numbers.</p>

In this section, we will introduce how to implement the differentiation modes using OCaml code. Of course, these will be elementary straw man implementation compared to the industry standard module provided by Owl, but nevertheless important to the understanding of the latter.</p>

<h3>Simple Forward Implementation</h3>
<p>How can we represent tbl.&nbsp;2? A intuitive answer is to build a table when traversing the computation graph. However, that’s not a scalable: what if there are hundreds and thousands of computation steps? A closer look at the tbl.&nbsp;2 shows that a intermediate node actually only need to know the computation results (primal value and tangent value) of its parents nodes to compute its own results. Based on this observation, we can define a data type that preserve these two values:</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre><code class="language-ocaml">type df = {
    mutable p: float;
    mutable t: float 
}

let primal df = df.p 
let tangent df = df.t</code></pre>
</div>
<p>And now we can define operators that accept type <code>df</code> as input and outputs the same type:</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre><code class="language-ocaml">let sin_ad df = 
    let p = primal df in 
    let t = tangent df in 
    let p' = Owl_maths.sin p in 
    let t' = (Owl_maths.cos p) *. t in 
    {p=p'; t=t'}</code></pre>
</div>
<p>EXPLAIN</p>
<p>Now you can easily extend towards the <code>exp</code> operation:</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre><code class="language-ocaml">let exp_ad df = 
    let p = primal df in 
    let t = tangent df in 
    let p' = Owl_maths.exp p in 
    let t' = p' *. t in 
    {p=p'; t=t'} </code></pre>
</div>
<p>But what about operators that accept multiple inputs? Let’s see multiplication.</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre><code class="language-ocaml">let mul_ad dfa dfb =
    let pa = primal dfa in 
    let ta = tangent dfa in 
    let pb = primal dfb in 
    let tb = tangent dfb in 
    let p' = pa *. pb in
    let t' = pa *. tb +. ta *. pb in 
    {p=p'; t=t'}</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Similarly, you can extend that towards similar operations: the <code>add</code> and <code>div</code>.</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre><code class="language-ocaml">let add_ad dfa dfb =
    let pa = primal dfa in 
    let ta = tangent dfa in

    let p' = pa +. pb in
    let t' = ta +. tb in 
    {p=p'; t=t'}

let div_ad dfa dfb =
    let pa = primal dfa in 
    let ta = tangent dfa in 
    let pb = primal dfb in 
    let tb = tangent dfb in

<h3>Simple Reverse Implementation</h3>
<p>(TODO: revise the code e.g.&nbsp;naming; explain the code as clear as possible since the adjoint function is very tricky. Use graph if necessary.)</p>
<p>The reverse mode is a bit more complex. As shown in the previous section, forward mode only need one pass, but the reverse differentiation requires a forward pass and a backward pass. That means, besides computing primal values, we also need to “remember” the operations along the forward pass, and then utilise these information in the backward pass. There can be multiple ways to do that, e.g.&nbsp;a stack or graph structure. What we choose here is bit different though. Start with the data types we use.</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre><code class="language-ocaml">type dr = {
    mutable p: float;
    mutable a: float ref;
  mutable adj_fun : float ref -&gt; (float * dr) list -&gt; (float * dr) list
}

let primal dr = dr.p 
let adjoint dr = dr.a
let adj_fun dr = dr.adj_fun</code></pre>
</div>
<p>The <code>p</code> is for primal and <code>a</code> stands for adjoint. It’s easy to understand. The <code>adj_fun</code> is a bit tricky. Let’s see an example:</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre><code class="language-ocaml">let sin_ad dr = 
    let p = primal dr in 
    let p' = Owl_maths.sin p in 
    let adjfun' ca t = 
        let r = !ca *. (Owl_maths.cos p) in 
        (r, dr) :: t
    in
    {p=p'; a=ref 0.; adj_fun=adjfun'}</code></pre>
</div>
<p>It’s an implementation of <code>sin</code> operation. The <code>adj_fun</code> here is leaves placeholder for the adjoint value we don’t know yet in the forward pass. The <code>t</code> stands for a stack of intermediate nodes to be processed in the backward process. It says that, if I have the adjoint value <code>ca</code>, I can then get the new adjoint value of my parents <code>r</code>. This result, together with the original data <code>dr</code>, is pushed to the stack <code>t</code>. This stack is implemented in OCaml list.</p>
<p>Let’s look at the <code>mul</code> operation:</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre><code class="language-ocaml">let mul_ad dr1 dr2 = 
    let p1 = primal dr1 in 
    let p2 = primal dr2 in 

    let p' = Owl_maths.mul p1 p2 in 
    let adjfun' ca t = 
        let r1 = !ca *. p2 in 
        let r2 = !ca *. p1 in 
        (r1, dr1) :: (r2, dr2) :: t
    in 
    {p = p'; a = ref 0.; adj_fun = adjfun'}</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Both of its parents are added to the task stack.</p>
<p>For the input data, we need a helper function:</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre><code class="language-ocaml">let make_reverse v = 
    let a = ref 0. in 
    let adj_fun _a t = t in 
    {p=v; a; adj_fun}</code></pre>
</div>
<p>With this function, we can do the forward pass like this:</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre data-filter-output=">" data-prompt="#" class="command-line"><code class="language-ocaml">let x = make_reverse 1. ;;
&gt;val x : dr = {p = 1.; a = {contents = 0.}; adj_fun = &lt;fun&gt;}
let y = make_reverse 2. ;;
&gt;val y : dr = {p = 2.; a = {contents = 0.}; adj_fun = &lt;fun&gt;}
let v = mul_ad (sin_ad x) y;;
&gt;val v : dr = {p = 1.68294196961579301; a = {contents = 0.}; adj_fun = &lt;fun&gt;}
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>After the forward pass, we have the primal values at each intermediate node, but their adjoint values are all set to zero, since we don’t know them yet. And we have this adjoin function. Noting that executing this function would create a list of past computations, which in turn contains its own <code>adj_fun</code>. This resulting <code>adj_fun</code> remembers all the required information, and know we need to recursively calculate the adjoint values we want.</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre><code class="language-ocaml">let rec reverse_push xs =
    match xs with 
    | [] -&gt; ()
    | (v, dr) :: t -&gt;
        let aa = adjoint dr in 
        let adjfun = adj_fun dr in 
        aa := !aa +. v;
        let stack = adjfun aa t in 
        reverse_push stack</code></pre>
</div>
<p>The <code>reverse_push</code> does exactly that. Stating from a list, it get the top element <code>dr</code>, get the adjoint value we already calculated <code>aa</code>, update it with <code>v</code> (explain why), get the <code>adj_fun</code>. Now that we know the adjoint value, we can use that as input parameter to the <code>adj_fun</code> to execute the data of current task and recursively execute more nodes until the task stack is empty.</p>
<p>Now, let’s add the other required operations:</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre><code class="language-ocaml">let exp_ad dr = 
    let p = primal dr in 
    let p' = Owl_maths.exp p in 
    let adjfun' ca t = 
        let r = !ca *. (Owl_maths.exp p) in 
        (r, dr) :: t
    in
    {p=p'; a=ref 0.; adj_fun=adjfun'}


let add_ad dr1 dr2 = 
    let p1 = primal dr1 in 
    let p2 = primal dr2 in 
    let p' = Owl_maths.add p1 p2 in 
    let adjfun' ca t = 
        let r1 = !ca in 
        let r2 = !ca in 
        (r1, dr1) :: (r2, dr2) :: t
    in 
    {p = p'; a = ref 0.; adj_fun = adjfun'}


let div_ad dr1 dr2 = 
    let p1 = primal dr1 in 
    let p2 = primal dr2 in 

    let p' = Owl_maths.div p1 p2 in 
    let adjfun' ca t = 
        let r1 = !ca /. p2 in 
        let r2 = !ca *. (-.p1) /. (p2 *. p2) in 
        (r1, dr1) :: (r2, dr2) :: t
    in 
    {p = p'; a = ref 0.; adj_fun = adjfun'}</code></pre>
</div>
<p>We can express the differentiation function <code>diff</code> with the reverse mode, with first a forward pass and then a backward pass.</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre><code class="language-ocaml">let diff f x = 
  (* forward pass *)
  let r = f x in 
  (* backward pass *)
  reverse_push [(1., r)];
  (* get result values *)
  let x0, x1 = x in 
  primal x0, !(adjoint x0), primal x1, !(adjoint x1)</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Now we can do the calculation, which are the same as before, only difference is the way to build constant values.</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre data-filter-output=">" data-prompt="#" class="command-line"><code class="language-ocaml">let x1 = make_reverse 1. ;;
&gt;val x1 : dr = {p = 1.; a = {contents = 0.}; adj_fun = &lt;fun&gt;}
let x0 = make_reverse 1. ;;
&gt;val x0 : dr = {p = 1.; a = {contents = 0.}; adj_fun = &lt;fun&gt;}
let f x =
  let x0, x1 = x in 
  let v2 = sin_ad x0 in
  let v3 = mul_ad x0 x1 in
  let v4 = add_ad v2 v3 in

  let v9 = div_ad v7 v8 in
  v9

&gt;val f : dr * dr -&gt; dr = &lt;fun&gt;

</div>
<p>Now let’s do the differentiation:</p>

<section class="level3" id="unified-implementations">
<h3>Unified Implementations</h3>
<p>Both methods seems OK, but in the real world application we often need a system that supports both differentiation modes. How can we build it then? We start with combining the previous two record data types <code>df</code> and <code>dr</code> into a new data type <code>t</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre><code class="language-ocaml">type t = 
    | DF of float * float  
    | DR of float * float ref * adjoint
    
and adjoint = float ref -&gt; (float * t) list -&gt; (float * t) list

let primal = function 
  | DF (p, _) -&gt; p 
  | DR (p, _, _) -&gt; p 

let tangent = function
  | DF (_, t) -&gt; t
  | DR (_, _, _) -&gt; failwith "error: no tangent for DR"

let adjoint = function 
  | DF (_, _) -&gt;  failwith "error: no adjoint for DF"
  | DR (_, a, _) -&gt; a 


let make_forward p a = DF (p, a)

let make_reverse p = 
    let a = ref 0. in 
    let adj_fun _a t = t in 
    DR (p, a, adj_fun)

let rec reverse_push xs =
  match xs with 
  | [] -&gt; ()
  | (v, x) :: t -&gt;
    (match x with 
    | DR (_, a, adjfun) -&gt;
      a := !a +. v;
      let stack = adjfun a t in 
      reverse_push stack
    | _ -&gt; failwith "error: unsupported type")</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Now we operate on one unified data type. Based on this new data type, we can then combine the forward and reverse mode into one single function, using a <code>match</code> clause.</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre><code class="language-ocaml">let sin_ad x =
  let ff = Owl_maths.sin in 
  let df p t = (Owl_maths.cos p) *. t in
  let dr p a = !a *. (Owl_maths.cos p) in 
  match x with 
  | DF (p, t) -&gt; 
    let p' = ff p in 
    let t' = df p t in 
    DF (p', t') 
  | DR (p, _, _) -&gt;
    let p' = ff p in 
    let adjfun' a t = 
      let r = dr p a in 
      (r, x) :: t 
    in 
    DR (p', ref 0., adjfun')</code></pre>
</div>
<p>The code is mostly taken from the previous two implementations, so should be not very alien to you now. Similarly we can also build the multiplication operator:</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre><code class="language-ocaml">let mul_ad xa xb = 
  let ff = Owl_maths.mul in 
  let df pa pb ta tb = pa *. tb +. ta *. pb in 
  let dr pa pb a = !a *. pb, !a *. pa in
  match xa, xb with 
  | DF (pa, ta), DF (pb, tb) -&gt;
    let p' = ff pa pb in 
    let t' = df pa pb ta tb in 
    DF (p', t') 
  | DR (pa, _, _), DR (pb, _, _) -&gt;
    let p' = ff pa pb in 
    let adjfun' a t = 
      let ra, rb = dr pa pb a in 
      (ra, xa) :: (rb, xb) :: t
    in 
    DR (p', ref 0., adjfun')
  | _, _ -&gt; failwith "unsupported op"</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Now before moving forward, let’s pause and think about what’s so different among different math functions. First, they may take different number of input arguments; they could be unary functions or binary functions. Second, they have different computation rules. Specifically, three type of computations are involved: <code>ff</code>, which computes the primal value; <code>df</code>, which computes the tangent value; and <code>dr</code>, which computes the adjoint value. The rest are mostly fixed.</p>
<p>Based on this observation, we can utilise the first-class citizen in OCaml: module, to reduce a lot of copy and paste in code. We can start with two types of modules: unary and binary:</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre><code class="language-ocaml">module type Unary = sig
  val ff : float -&gt; float

  val df : float -&gt; float -&gt; float 

  val dr : float -&gt; float ref -&gt; float
end

module type Binary = sig
  val ff : float -&gt; float -&gt; float

  val df : float -&gt; float -&gt; float -&gt; float -&gt; float 

  val dr : float -&gt; float -&gt; float ref -&gt; float * float
end</code></pre>
</div>
<p>They express both points of difference: first, the two module differentiate between unary and binary ops; second, each module represents the three core operations: <code>ff</code>, <code>df</code>, and <code>dr</code>. We can focus on the computation logic of each computation in each module:</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre><code class="language-ocaml">module Sin = struct 
  let ff = Owl_maths.sin
  let df p t = (Owl_maths.cos p) *. t
  let dr p a = !a *. (Owl_maths.cos p)
end

module Exp = struct 
  let ff = Owl_maths.exp
  let df p t = (Owl_maths.exp p) *. t
  let dr p a = !a *. (Owl_maths.exp p)
end

module Mul = struct 
  let ff = Owl_maths.mul
  let df pa pb ta tb = pa *. tb +. ta *. pb 
  let dr pa pb a = !a *. pb, !a *. pa
end

module Add = struct 
  let ff = Owl_maths.add
  let df _pa _pb ta tb = ta +. tb
  let dr _pa _pb a = !a, !a
end

module Div = struct 
  let ff = Owl_maths.div
  let df pa pb ta tb = (ta *. pb -. tb *. pa) /. (pb *. pb)
  let dr pa pb a = 
     !a /. pb, !a *. (-.pa) /. (pb *. pb) 
end</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Now we can provide a template to build math functions:</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre><code class="language-ocaml">let unary_op (module U: Unary) = fun x -&gt;

    DF (p', t') 
  | DR (p, _, _) -&gt;
    let p' = U.ff p in 
    let adjfun' a t = 
      let r = U.dr p a in 
      (r, x) :: t 
    in 
    DR (p', ref 0., adjfun')


let binary_op (module B: Binary) = fun xa xb -&gt;
  match xa, xb with 
  | DF (pa, ta), DF (pb, tb) -&gt;
    let p' = B.ff pa pb in 
    let t' = B.df pa pb ta tb in

</div>
<p>Each template accepts a module, and then returns the function we need. Let’s see how it works with concise code.</p>
<div class="highlight">

<p>As you can expect, the <code>diff</code> function can also be implemented in a combined way. In this implementation we focus on the tangent and adjoint value of <code>x0</code> only.</p>

<h2>Forward and Reverse Propagation API</h2>
<p>So far we have talked a lot about what is Algorithmic Differentiation and how it works, with theory, example illustration, and code. Now finally let’s turn to how to use it in Owl.</p>
<p>Owl provides both numerical differentiation (in <a href="https://github.com/owlbarn/owl/blob/master/src/base/optimise/owl_numdiff_generic_sig.ml">Numdiff.Generic</a> module) and algorithmic differentiation (in <a href="https://github.com/owlbarn/owl/blob/master/src/base/algodiff/owl_algodiff_generic_sig.ml">Algodiff.Generic</a> module). We have briefly used them in previous sections to validate the calculation results of our manual forward and reverse differentiation.</p>
<p>Algorithmic Differentiation is a core module built in Owl, which is one of Owl’s special feature among other similar numerical libraries. <code>Algodiff.Generic</code> is a functor that accept a Ndarray modules. By plugging in <code>Dense.Ndarray.S</code> and <code>Dense.Ndarray.D</code> modules we can have AD modules that support <code>float32</code> and <code>float64</code> precision respectively.</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre><code class="language-clike">module S = Owl_algodiff_generic.Make (Owl_algodiff_primal_ops.S)
module D = Owl_algodiff_generic.Make (Owl_algodiff_primal_ops.D)</code></pre>
</div>
<p>EXPLAIN what is this <code>Owl_algodiff_primal_ops</code> thing. We will mostly use the double precision <code>Algodiff.D</code> module, but of course using other choices is also perfectly fine.</p>
<section class="level3" id="expressing-computation">
<h3>Expressing Computation</h3>
<p>Let’s look at the the previous example of eq.&nbsp;4, and express it in the AD module. Normally, the code below should do.</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre><code class="language-ocaml">open Owl 

let f x = 
    let x0 = Mat.get x 0 0 in 
    let x1 = Mat.get x 0 1 in
    Owl_maths.(1. /. (1. +. exp (sin x0 +. x0 *. x1)))</code></pre>
</div>
<p>This function accept a vector and returns a float value; exactly what we are looking for. However, the problem is that we cannot directly differentiate this programme. Instead, we need to do some minor but important change:</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre><code class="language-ocaml">module AD = Algodiff.D

let f x = 
    let x0 = AD.Mat.get x 0 0 in 
    let x1 = AD.Mat.get x 0 1 in
    AD.Maths.((F 1.) / (F 1. + exp (sin x0 + x0 * x1)))</code></pre>
</div>
<p>This function looks very similar, but now we are using the operators provided in the AD module, including the <code>get</code> operation and math operations. In AD, all the input/output are of type <code>AD.t</code>. There is no difference between scalar, matrix, or ndarray for the type checking.</p>
<p>The <code>F</code> is special packing mechanism in AD. It makes a type <code>t</code> float. Think about wrap a float number inside a container that can be recognised in this factory called “AD”. And then this factory can produce what differentiation result you want. The <code>Arr</code> operator is similar. It wraps an ndarray (or matrix) inside this same container. And as you can guess, there are also unpacking mechanisms. When this AD factory produces some result, to see the result you need to first unwrap this container with the functions <code>unpack_flt</code> and <code>unpack_arr</code>. It can be illustrated in the figure below.</p>
<p>IMAGE: a box with packing and unpacking channels</p>
<p>For example, we can directly execute the AD functions, and the results need to be unpacked before being used.</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre><code class="language-clike">open AD 

# let input = Arr (Dense.Matrix.D.ones 1 2)
# let result = f input |&gt; unpack_flt

# val result : float = 0.13687741466075895</code></pre>
</div>
<p>As a trade with this slightly cumbersome packing mechanism, we can now perform. Next, we show how to perform the forward and reverse propagation on this computation in Owl.</p>
</section>
<section class="level3" id="example-forward-mode">
<h3>Example: Forward Mode</h3>
<p>The forward mode is implemented with the <code>make_forward</code> and <code>tangent</code> function:</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre><code class="language-clike">val make_forward : t -&gt; t -&gt; int -&gt; t

val tangent : t -&gt; t </code></pre>
</div>
<p>The forward process is straightforward.</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre><code class="language-clike">open AD 

# let x = make_forward input (F 1.) (tag ());;  (* seed the input *)
# let y = f x;;                                  (* forward pass *)
# let y' = tangent y;;                           (* get all derivatives *)</code></pre>
</div>
<p>All the derivatives are ready whenever the forward pass is finished, and they are stored as tangent values in <code>y</code>. We can retrieve the derivatives using <code>tangent</code> function.</p>
</section>
<section class="level3" id="example-reverse-mode">
<h3>Example: Reverse Mode</h3>
<p>The reverse mode consists of two parts:</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre><code class="language-clike">val make_reverse : t -&gt; int -&gt; t

val reverse_prop : t -&gt; t -&gt; unit</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Let’s look at the code snippet below.</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre><code class="language-clike">open AD

# let x = Mat.ones 1 2;;              (* generate random input *)
# let x' = make_reverse x (tag ());;  (* init the reverse mode *)
# let y = f x';;                      (* forward pass to build computation graph *)
# let _ = reverse_prop (F 1.) y;;     (* backward pass to propagate error *)
# let y' = adjval x';;                (* get the gradient value of f *)

- : A.arr =
          C0        C1
R0 -0.181974 -0.118142</code></pre>
</div>
<p><code>make_reverse</code> function does two things for us: 1) wrap <code>x</code> into type <code>t</code> that Algodiff can process 2) generate a unique tag for the input so that input numbers can have nested structure. By calling <code>f x'</code>, we construct the computation graph of <code>f</code> and the graph structure is maintained in the returned result <code>y</code>. Finally, <code>reverse_prop</code> function propagates the error back to the inputs. In the end, the gradient of <code>f</code> is stored in the adjacent value of <code>x'</code>, and we can retrieve that with <code>adjval</code> function. The result agrees with what we have calculated manually.</p>

<section class="level2" id="high-level-apis">
<h2>High-Level APIs</h2>
<p>What we have seen is the basic of AD modules. There might be cases you do need to operate these low-level functions to write up your own applications (e.g., implementing a neural network), then knowing the mechanisms behind the scene is definitely a big plus. However, using these complex low level function hinders daily use of algorithmic differentiation in numerical computation task. In reality, you don’t really need to worry about forward or reverse mode if you simply use high-level APIs such as <code>diff</code>, <code>grad</code>, <code>hessian</code>, and etc. They are all built on the forward or reverse mode that we have seen, but provide clean interfaces, making a lot of details transparent to users. In this chapter we will introduce how to use these core high level APIs with examples.</p>
<section class="level3" id="derivative">
<h3>Derivative</h3>
<p>The most basic and commonly used differentiation functions is used for calculating the <em>derivative</em> of a function. The AD module provides <code>diff</code> function for this task. Given a function <code>f</code> that takes a scalar as input and also returns a scalar value, we can calculate its derivative at a point <code>x</code> by <code>diff f x</code>, as shown in this function signature.</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre><code class="language-clike">val diff : (t -&gt; t) -&gt; t -&gt; t</code></pre>
</div>
<p>The physical meaning of derivative is intuitive. The function <code>f</code> can be expressed as a curve in a cartesian coordinate system, and the derivative at a point is the tangent on a function at this point. It also indicate the rate of change at this point.</p>
<p>Suppose we define a function <code>f0</code> to be the triangular function <code>tanh</code>, we can calculate its derivative at position <span class="math inline">\(x=0.1\)</span> by simply calling:</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre><code class="language-ocaml">open Algodiff.D

let f0 x = Maths.(tanh x)
let d = diff f0 (F 0.1)</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Moreover, the AD module is much more than that; we can easily chains multiple <code>diff</code> together to get a function’s high order derivatives. For example, we can get the first to fourth order derivatives of <code>f0</code> by using the code below.</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre><code class="language-ocaml">let f0 x = Maths.(tanh x);;
let f1 = diff f0;;
let f2 = diff f1;;
let f3 = diff f2;;
let f4 = diff f3;;</code></pre>
</div>
<p>We can further plot these five functions using Owl, and the result is show in fig.&nbsp;4.</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre><code class="language-ocaml">let map f x = Owl.Mat.map (fun a -&gt; a |&gt; pack_flt |&gt; f |&gt; unpack_flt) x;;

let x = Owl.Mat.linspace (-4.) 4. 200;;
let y0 = map f0 x;;
let y1 = map f1 x;;
let y2 = map f2 x;;
let y3 = map f3 x;;
let y4 = map f4 x;;

let h = Plot.create "plot_00.png" in
Plot.plot ~h x y0;
Plot.plot ~h x y1;
Plot.plot ~h x y2;
Plot.plot ~h x y3;
Plot.plot ~h x y4;
Plot.output h;;</code></pre>

</figure>
<p>If you want, you can play with other functions, such as <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1-e^{-x}}{1+e^{-x}}\)</span> to see what its derivatives look like.</p>
</section>
<section class="level3" id="gradient">
<h3>Gradient</h3>
<p>As we have introduced in eq.&nbsp;2, gradient generalise derivatives to multivariate functions. Therefore, for a function that accept a vector (where each element is a variable), and returns a scalar, we can use the <code>grad</code> function to find it gradient at a point. For example, fig.&nbsp;5 shows the gradients at different points on a 3D surface (<a href="https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/new-in-8/new-and-improved-scientific-and-information-visualization/show-the-gradient-field-on-a-surface.html">src</a>). At each of these of points, a gradient consists of three element that each represents the derivative along the x, y or z axis. This vector shows the direction and magnitude of maximum change of a multivariate function.</p>
<figure>
<img alt="" style="width:60.0%" id="fig:algodiff:gradient_example" title="gradient_example" src="images/algodiff/gradient.png"><figcaption>Figure 5: Gradient field on a 3D surface</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>TODO: replace this image with that of owl-plplot</p>
<p>One important application of gradient is the <em>gradient descent</em>, a widely used technique to find minimum values on a function. The basic idea is that, at any point on the surface, we calculate the gradient to find the current direction of maximal change at this point, and move the point along this direction by a small step, and then repeat this process until the point cannot be further moved. We will talk about it in detail in the Regression an Optimisation chapters in our book.</p>
<p>As an example, we calculate the gradient of a physical function. The fourth chapter of <span data-cites="feynman1964feynman" class="citation">(Feynman 1964)</span> describes an electronic fields. It consists two point charges, <code>+q</code> and <code>-q</code>, separated by the distance <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>. The z axis goes through the charges, and the origin is set to halfway between these two charges. The potential from the two charges can be described by</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\phi(x,y,z)=\frac{1}{4\pi~\epsilon_0}\left(\frac{q}{\sqrt{(z-d/2)^2 + x^2 + y^2}} + \frac{-q}{\sqrt{(z+d/2)^2 + x^2 + y^2}}\right)\]</span></p>
</section>
<section class="level3" id="jacobian">
<h3>Jacobian</h3>
<p>Just like gradient extends derivative, the gradient can also be extended to the <em>Jacobian matrix</em>. The <code>grad</code> can be applied on functions with vector as input and scalar as output. The <code>jacobian</code> function on the hand, deals with functions that has both input and output of vectors. Suppose the input vector is of length <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, and contains <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> output variables, the jacobian matrix is defined as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \mathbf{J}(y) = \left[ \begin{matrix} \frac{\partial~y_1}{\partial~x_1} &amp; \frac{\partial~y_1}{\partial~x_1} &amp; \ldots &amp; \frac{\partial~y_1}{\partial~x_n} \\ \frac{\partial~y_2}{\partial~x_0} &amp; \frac{\partial~y_2}{\partial~x_1} &amp; \ldots &amp; \frac{\partial~y_2}{\partial~x_n} \\ \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ldots &amp; \vdots \\ \frac{\partial~y_m}{\partial~x_0} &amp; \frac{\partial~y_m}{\partial~x_1} &amp; \ldots &amp; \frac{\partial~y_m}{\partial~x_n} \end{matrix} \right]\]</span></p>
<p>The intuition of Jacobian is similar to that of the gradient. At a particular point in the domain of the target function, If you give it a small change in the input vector, the Jacobian matrix shows how the output vector changes. One application field of Jacobian is in the analysis of dynamical systems. In a dynamic system <span class="math inline">\(\vec{y}=f(\vec{x})\)</span>, suppose <span class="math inline">\(f: \mathbf{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbf{R}^m\)</span> is differentiable and its jacobian is <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{J}\)</span>.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hartman%E2%80%93Grobman_theorem">Hartman-Grobman</a> theorem, the behaviour of the system near a stationary point is related to the eigenvalues of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{J}\)</span>. Specifically, if the eigenvalues all have real parts that are negative, then the system is stable near the stationary point, if any eigenvalue has a real part that is positive, then the point is unstable. If the largest real part of the eigenvalues is zero, the Jacobian matrix does not allow for an evaluation of the stability. (COPY ALERT)</p>
<p>Let’s revise the two-body problem from Ordinary Differential Equation Chapter. This dynamic system is described by a group of differential equations:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[y_0^{'} = y_2,\]</span> <span class="math display">\[y_1^{'} = y_3,\]</span> <span id="eq:algodiff:twobody_system"><span class="math display">\[y_2^{'} = -\frac{y_0}{r^3},\qquad(6)\]</span></span> <span class="math display">\[y_3^{'} = -\frac{y_1}{r^3},\]</span></p>
<p>We can express this system with code:</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre><code class="language-ocaml">open Algodiff.D

let f y =
  let y0 = Mat.get y 0 0 in 
  let y1 = Mat.get y 0 1 in 
  let y2 = Mat.get y 0 2 in 
  let y3 = Mat.get y 0 3 in 

  let r = Maths.(sqrt ((sqr y0) + (sqr y1))) in
  let y0' = y2 in
  let y1' = y3 in
  let y2' = Maths.( neg y0 / pow r (F 3.)) in
  let y3' = Maths.( neg y1 / pow r (F 3.)) in

  let y' = Mat.ones 1 4 in
  let y' = Mat.set y' 0 0 y0' in
  let y' = Mat.set y' 0 1 y1' in
  let y' = Mat.set y' 0 2 y2' in
  let y' = Mat.set y' 0 3 y3' in
  y'</code></pre>
</div>
<p>For this functions <span class="math inline">\(f: \mathbf{R}^4 \rightarrow \mathbf{R}^4\)</span>, we can then find its Jacobian matrix. Suppose the given point of interest of where all four input variables equals one. Then we can use the <code>Algodiff.D.jacobian</code> function in this way.</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre><code class="language-text">let y = Mat.ones 1 4 
let result = jacobian f y 

let j = unpack_arr result;;
- : A.arr =

         C0       C1 C2 C3
R0        0        0  1  0
R1        0        0  0  1
R2 0.176777  0.53033  0  0
R3  0.53033 0.176777  0  0</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Next, we find the eigenvalues of this jacobian matrix with the Linear Algebra module in Owl that we have introduced in previous chapter.</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre><code class="language-text">let eig = Owl_linalg.D.eigvals j 

val eig : Owl_dense_matrix_z.mat =

               C0              C1             C2              C3
R0 (0.840896, 0i) (-0.840896, 0i) (0, 0.594604i) (0, -0.594604i)</code></pre>
</div>
<p>It turns out that one eigenvalue is real and positive, so the corresponding component of the solutions is growing. One eigenvalue is real and negative, indicating a decaying component. The other two eigenvalues are pure imaginary numbers. representing oscillatory components. (COPY ALERT) The analysis result shows that at current point the system is unstable.</p>
</section>
<section class="level3" id="hessian-and-laplacian">
<h3>Hessian and Laplacian</h3>
<p>Another way to extend the gradient is to find the second order derivative of a multivariate function which takes <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> input variables and outputs a scalar. Its second order derivatives can be organised as a matrix:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \mathbf{H}(y) = \left[ \begin{matrix} \frac{\partial^2~y_1}{\partial~x_1^2} &amp; \frac{\partial^2~y_1}{\partial~x_1~x_2} &amp; \ldots &amp; \frac{\partial^2~y_1}{\partial~x_1~x_n} \\ \frac{\partial^2~y_2}{\partial~x_2~x_1} &amp; \frac{\partial^2~y_2}{\partial~x_2^2} &amp; \ldots &amp; \frac{\partial^2~y_2}{\partial~x_2~x_n} \\ \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ldots &amp; \vdots \\ \frac{\partial^2~y_m}{\partial^2~x_n~x_1} &amp; \frac{\partial^2~y_m}{\partial~x_n~x_2} &amp; \ldots &amp; \frac{\partial^2~y_m}{\partial~x_n^2} \end{matrix} \right]\]</span></p>
<p>TODO: intuition of hessian.</p>
<p>As an example of using Hessian matrix, consider the <em>newton’s method</em>. It is also used for solving the optimisation problem, i.e.&nbsp;to find the minimum value on a function. Instead of following the direction of the gradient, the newton method combines gradient and second order gradients: <span class="math inline">\(\frac{\nabla~f(x_n)}{\nabla^{2}~f(x_n)}\)</span>. Specifically, starting from a random position <span class="math inline">\(x_0\)</span>, and it can be iteratively updated by repeating this procedure until converge, as shown in eq.&nbsp;7.</p>
<p><span id="eq:algodiff:newtons"><span class="math display">\[x_(n+1) = x_n - \alpha~\mathbf{H}^{-1}\nabla~f(x_n)\qquad(7)\]</span></span></p>

<p>We can then apply this method on a two dimensional triangular function to find one of the local minimum values, staring from a random initial point. Note that here the functions has to take a vector as input and output a scalar.</p>

<p>We will come back to this example in the in Optimisation chapter with more details.</p>
<p>Another useful and related function is <code>laplacian</code>, it calculate the <em>Laplacian operator</em> <span class="math inline">\(\nabla^2~f\)</span>, which is the the trace of the Hessian matrix:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\nabla^2~f=trace(H_f)= \sum_{i=1}^{n}\frac{\partial^2f}{\partial~x_i^2}.\]</span></p>
<p>The Laplacian occurs in differential equations that describe many physical phenomena, such as electric and gravitational potentials, the diffusion equation for heat and fluid flow, wave propagation, and quantum mechanics. The Laplacian represents the flux density of the gradient flow of a function. For instance, the net rate at which a chemical dissolved in a fluid moves toward or away from some point is proportional to the Laplacian of the chemical concentration at that point; expressed symbolically, the resulting equation is the diffusion equation. For these reasons, it is extensively used in the sciences for modelling all kinds of physical phenomena. (COPY ALERT)</p>

<h3>Other APIs</h3>
<p>Besides, there are also many helper functions, such as <code>jacobianv</code> for calculating jacobian vector product; <code>diff'</code> for calculating both <code>f x</code> and <code>diff f x</code>, and etc. They will come handy in certain cases for the programmers. Besides the functions we have already introduced, the complete list of APIs can be found below.</p>

<p><strong>More Examples in Book</strong> Differentiation is an important topic in scientific computing, and therefore is not limited to only this chapter in our book. As we have already shown in previous examples, we use AD in the newton method to find extreme values in optimisation problem in the Optimisation chapter. It is also used in the Regression chapter to solve the linear regression problem with gradient descent. More importantly, the algorithmic differentiation is core module in many modern deep neural libraries such as PyTorch. The neural network module in Owl benefit a lot from our solid AD module. We will elaborate these aspects in the following chapters. Stay tuned!</p>
