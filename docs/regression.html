<h1>Regression</h1>
<p>Regression is an important topic in statistical modelling and machine learning. It’s about modelling problems that includes one or more variables (also called “features” or “predictors”) and making predictions of another variable (“output variable”) based on previous data of predictors.</p>
<p>Regression analysis includes a wide range of models, from linear regression to isotonic regression, each with different theory background and application fields. Introducing all these models are beyond this book. In this chapter, we focus on several common form of regressions, mainly linear regression and logistic regression. We introduce their basic ideas, how they are supported in Owl, and how to use them to solve problems.</p>

<h2>Linear Regression</h2>
<p>Linear regression models the relationship of the features and output variable with a linear model. Let’s start with a simple problem where only one feature needs to be considered.</p>
<section class="level3" id="problem-where-to-locate-a-new-mcdonalds-restaurant">
<h3>Problem: Where to locate a new McDonald’s restaurant?</h3>
<p>McDonald’s is no doubt one of the most successful fast food chains in the world. Up to 2018, it has already had more than 37, 000 stores world wide, and surely more is being built as you are reading. One question then is: where to locate a new McDonald’s restaurant?</p>
<p>According to its <a href="https://www.mcdonalds.com/gb/en-gb/help/faq/18665-how-do-you-decide-where-to-open-a-new-restaurant.html#">website</a>, a lot of factors are in play: area population, existing stores in the area, proximity to retail parks, shopping centres, etc. Now let’s simplified this problem by asserting that the potential profit is only related to area population. Suppose you are the decision maker in McDonald’s, and also have access to data of each branch store (profit, population around this branch). Now linear regression would be a good friend when you are deciding where to locate your next branch.</p>
<p>Here list a part of the data (TODO: link to csv file):</p>

<p>TODO: CODE and IMAGE in Owl</p>
<p>According to this figure, there is a clear trend that larger population and larger profit are co-related together. But precisely how?</p>
</section>
<section class="level3" id="cost-function">
<h3>Cost Function</h3>
<p>Let’s start with a linear hypothesis that the the relationship between these two variables be formalised as: <span class="math display">\[ y = \theta_0~ + \theta_1~x_1\]</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> denotes the profit we want to predict, and input variable <span class="math inline">\(x_1\)</span> is the population number in this example. Also, we have shown the “<span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-<span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>” pairs in the data above, and we represent the total number of data pairs with <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>.</p>
<p>The <span class="math inline">\(\theta_0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(theta_1\)</span> are the parameters of this model. Mathematically they decide a line on a plain. We can now choose randomly these parameters and see how the result works, and some of these guesses are just bad intuitively. Our target is to choose suitable parameters so that the line is <em>close</em> to data we observed.</p>
<p>TODO: Figures with data, and also some random lines. Maybe three figures, and two of them are bad fit.</p>
<p>Define “close”:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[E(\Theta) = \frac{1}{2n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}(h_{\Theta}(x_i - y_i)^2)\]</span></p>
<p>We call it the cost function. It’s physical meaning; maximise likelihood</p>
</section>
<section class="level3" id="solving-problem-with-gradient-descent">
<h3>Solving Problem with Gradient Descent</h3>
<p>Why gradient descent? We have this surf image:</p>
<p>IMAGE</p>
<p>It shows how cost function changes with both <span class="math inline">\(\theta_0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\theta_1\)</span>. We can thus use GD to locate the local minimal value.</p>
<p>How GD works:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \theta_j \leftarrow \theta_j - \alpha~\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta_j}~J(\theta_0, \theta_1) \]</span></p>
<p>The second part means the direction, and the second part gives the step size.</p>
<p>This seemingly terrible partial derivative is actually simple to do:</p>
<p>EQUATION</p>
<p>Following these equations, you can perform the process until converges:</p>
<p>CODE</p>
<p>And now we get the result.</p>
<p>PLOT: the resulting line against data samples.</p>
<p>Of course, we can also directly use the GD optimisation method in Owl:</p>
<p>CODE</p>
<p>The result would be similar.</p>

<section class="level2" id="multiple-regression">
<h2>Multiple Regression</h2>
<p>Now the same problem, but variables goes from one to multiple. What would you do? Basically similar, but instead of <span class="math inline">\(\theta_0\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\theta_1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\theta_2\)</span>, … now we need the vectorised representation: <span class="math inline">\(\Theta\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ J(\Theta) = \frac{1}{2n}(X\Theta - y)^2\]</span>.</p>
<p>Next we focus on some issues.</p>

<p>Besides GD, there is actually one close form solution to Linear Regression:</p>

<p>So far we have been predicting a value for our problems, but what if we don’t care about is not the value, but a classification? For example, we want to know if this tumour is cancer or not given previous data.</p>
<p>We can of course continue to use linear regression to represent the possibility of one of these result, but one issue is that, it could well be out of the bounds of [0, 1].</p>

<p>With this function, instead of <span class="math inline">\(h = \Theta~X\)</span>, the problem can be modelled as:</p>

<p>Now we defined it this way: Cost equation that involves <span class="math inline">\(log\)</span> function. Explain how it comes: maximise the log likelihood</p>
<p>Therefore, we have this cost function:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ J(\Theta) = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\textrm{Cost}(h_{\Theta}(x_i), y_i)\]</span></p>
</section>
<section class="level3" id="gradient-descent">
<h3>Gradient Descent</h3>
<p>How to solve this terrible equation?</p>
<p>The sigmoid has a nice property: its derivative is simple:</p>
<p>EQUATION</p>
<p>Therefore, similar to LR, we only need to repeat this step until converges:</p>
<p>EQUATION</p>
<p>Let’s write that in Owl:</p>
<p>CODE #1: plain code</p>
<p>CODE #2: use existing function in Owl</p>
<p>Plotting the boundaries.</p>

<section class="level3" id="multi-class-classification">
<h3>Multi-class classification</h3>
<p>Similar to the LR problem, you hardly stop at 2 parameters. What if we need to classified an object into one fo multiple classes?</p>
<p>One popular classification problem is the hand-written recognition task. It is… It is a widely used ABC task for Neural Networks, and we will also cover it later in Chapter DNN. For now, we solve that from the logistic regression line of thought.</p>
<p>Dataset description Visualise</p>
<p>Similarly, we extend the cost function towards multi-class:</p>
<p>EQUATION</p>
<p>We can also use the generalised version of GD as before, or directly apply GD method in Owl:</p>

<p>Let’s apply the model on test data:</p>
