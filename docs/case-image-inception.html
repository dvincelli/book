<h1>Case - Image Recognition</h1>
<p>How can a computer take an image and answer questions like “what is in this picture? A cat, dog, or something else?” In the last few years the field of machine learning has made tremendous progress on addressing this difficult problem. In particular, Deep Neural Network (DNN) can achieve reasonable performance on visual recognition tasks – matching or exceeding human performance in some domains.</p>
<p>We have introduced the neural network module in previous chapter. In this chapter, we will show one specific example that is built on the neural network module: using the InceptionV3 architecture to perform the image classification task.</p>
<section class="level2" id="background">
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>InceptionV3 is a a widely-used image classification DNN architecture that can attain significant accuracy with small amount of parameters. It is not invented out of thin air. The development using DNN to perform image recognition is a stream that dates back to more than 20 years ago. During this period, the research in this area is pushed forward again and again in various work. In this chapter, we first introduce how image classification architectures are developed up until Inception. They will be helpful to understand how Inception architectures are built.</p>
<section class="level3" id="lenet">
<h3>LeNet</h3>
<p>In the regression chapter, we have seen a simple neural network that contains three layer, and use it to recognise the simple handwritten numbers from the MNSIT dataset. Here, each pixel acts as an input feature. Remember that each image can be seen as a ndarray. For a black and white image such as the MNSIT image, pixels are interpreted as a matrix. Every pixel has a value between 0 and 255. For a color image, it can be interpreted as a 3-dimension array with three channels, each corresponding to the blue, green, and red layer.</p>
<p>However, we cannot rely on adding more fully connected layers to do real world high precision image detections. One important improvement that the Convolution Neural Network make is that it uses filters in the convolution operation. As a result, instead of using the whole image as an array of features, the image is divided into a number of tiles. They will then serve as the basic feature of the network’s prediction.</p>
<p>Explain and visualise “feature” and feature map.</p>
<p>The next building block is the pooling layer. Recall from the neural network chapter that, both average pooling and max pooling can aggregate information from multiple pixels into one and “blur” the input image or feature. So why it is so important? By reducing the size of input, pooling helps to reduce the number of parameters and the amount of computation required. Besides, blurring the features is a way to limit over-fitting training data.</p>
<p>At the end, only connect high-level features with fully connection. This is the structure proposed in <span data-cites="lecun1998gradient" class="citation">(LeCun et al. 1998)</span>. This whole process can be shown in fig.&nbsp;1.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>(Or use the LeCun paper figure)</p>
<p>In general, layers of convolution retrieve information from detailed to more abstracted gradually. In a DNN, The lower layers of neurons retrieve information about simple shapes such as edges and points. Going higher, the neurons can capture complex structures, such as the tire of a car, the face of a cat, etc. Close to the top layers, the neurons can retrieve and abstract complex ideas, such as “car”, “cat”, etc. And then finally generates the classification results.</p>
</section>
<section class="level3" id="alexnet">
<h3>AlexNet</h3>
<p>Next breakthrough comes from the AlexNet proposed in <span data-cites="krizhevsky2012imagenet" class="citation">(Krizhevsky, Sutskever, and Hinton 2012)</span>. It proposes the activation layer to increase <em>non-linearity</em>. Operations such as convolution includes mainly linear operations such as matrix multiplication and add. But that’s not how the real world data looks like. Remember that from the previou Regression chapter, though linear regression is basic, but for most of the real world application we need more complex method such as polynomial regression. The same can be applied here. We need to increase the non-linearity to accommodate real world data such as image.</p>
<p>There are multiple activation choice, such as <code>tanh</code> and <code>sigmoid</code>. However, the <code>relu</code> operation, which set negative values of a feature map to zero, is frequently used. It makes training faster, and accuracy loss in gradient computation is small.</p>
<p>Another thing that AlexNet proposes is to use the <code>dropout</code> layer. It is mainly used to solve the over-fitting problem. This operation only works at training time. It randomly makes the elements in a ndarray from the last layer to be zero, and thus “deactivate” the knowledge that can be learnt from these points. In this way, the network intentionally drops certain part of training examples and avoid the over-fitting problem. It is similar to the regularisation method we use in the linear regression.</p>
<p>The one more thing that we need to take a note from AlexNet is that by going deeper make the network “longer”, we achieve better accuracy. So instead of just convolution and pooling, we now build convolution followed by convolution and then pooling, and repeat this process again…. A deeper network captures finer features, and this would be a trend that is followed by successive architectures.</p>
</section>
<section class="level3" id="vgg">
<h3>VGG</h3>
<p>The VGG network proposed in <span data-cites="simonyan2014very" class="citation">(Simonyan and Zisserman 2014)</span> is the next step after AlexNet. The most notable change that introduced by VGG is that it uses small kernel sizes such as <code>3x3</code> instead of the <code>11x11</code> with a large stride of 4 in AlexNet.</p>
<p>Using multiple small kernels is much more flexible than only using a large one. For example, for an input image, by applying two <code>3x3</code> kernels with slide size of 1, that equals to using a <code>5x5</code> kernel. If stacking three <code>3x3</code>, it equals using one <code>7x7</code> convolution.</p>
<p>By replacing large kernels with multiple small kernels, the number of parameter is visibly reduced. In the previous two examples, replace one <code>5x5</code> with two <code>3x3</code>, we reduce the parameter by <span class="math inline">\(1 - 2 * 3 * 3 / (5 * 5) = 28%\)</span>. Replace the <code>7x7</code> kernel, and we save parameters by <span class="math inline">\(1 - 3 * 3 * 3 / ( 7 * 7) = 45%\)</span>.</p>
<p>Therefore, with this reduction of parameter size, we can now build network with more layers, which tends to yield better performance. The VGG networks comes with two variates, VGG16 and VGG19, which are the same in structure, and the only difference is that VGG19 is deeper.</p>
<p>One extra benefit is that using small kernels increases non-linearity. Image an extreme case where the kernel is as large as the input image, then the whole convolution is just one big matrix multiplication, a totally linear operations. As we have just explained in the previous section, we hope to reduce the linearity in training CNN to accommodate more real-world problems.</p>
</section>
<section class="level3" id="resnet">
<h3>ResNet</h3>
<p>We keep saying that building deeper network is the trend. However, going deeper has its limit. The deeper you go, the more you will experience the “vanishing gradient” problem. This problems is that, in a very deep network, during the back-propagation phase, the repeated multiplication operations will make the gradients very small, and thus the performance affected.</p>
<p>The ResNet in <span data-cites="he2016deep" class="citation">(He et al. 2016)</span> proposes a “identity shortcut connection” that skips one or more layers and combine with predecessor layers. It is called a residual block, as shown in this figure.</p>
<p>FIGURE: residual block</p>
<p>We can see that there is the element-wise addition that combines the information of the current output and its predecessors two layers ago. It solves the gradient problem in stacking layers, since now the the error can be backpropagated through multiple paths. The authors shows that during training the deeper layers do not produce a error higher than its predecessor in lower layer.</p>
<p>Also note that the residual block aggregating features from different level of layers, instead of purely stacking them. This patten proves to be useful and will also be used in the Inception architecture.</p>

<section class="level2" id="building-inceptionv3-network">
<h2>Building InceptionV3 Network</h2>
<p>Proppsed by Christian Szegedy et. al., <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.00567">InceptionV3</a> is one of Google’s latest effort to do image recognition. It is trained for the <a href="http://www.image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/">ImageNet Large Visual Recognition Challenge</a>. This is a standard task in computer vision, where models try to classify entire images into 1000 classes, like “Zebra”, “Dalmatian”, and “Dishwasher”, etc. Compared with previous DNN models, InceptionV3 has one of the most complex networks architectures in computer vision.</p>
<p>The design of image recognition networks is about the tradeoff between computation cost, memory usage, and accuracy. Just increasing model size and computation cost tends to increase the accuracy, but the benefit will decrease soon. To solve this problem, compared to previous similar networks, the Inception architecture aims to perform well with strict constraints on memory and computational budget. This design follows several principles, such as balancing the width and depth of the network, and performing spatial aggregation over lower dimensional embeddings can lead to small loss in representational power of networks. The resulting Inception network architectures has high performance and a relatively modest computation cost compared to simpler, more monolithic architectures.</p>
<section class="level3" id="inceptionv1-and-inceptionv2">
<h3>InceptionV1 and InceptionV2</h3>
<p>The reason we say “InceptionV3” is because it is developed based on two previous similar architectures. To understand InceptionV3, we first need to know the characteristics of its predecessors.</p>
<p>The first version of Inception, GoogLeNet <span data-cites="szegedy2015going" class="citation">(Szegedy et al. 2015)</span>, proposes to combine convolutions with different filter sizes on the same input, and then concatenate the resulting features together. Think about an image of a bird. If you sticking with using a normal square filter, then perhaps the features such as “feather” is a bit difficult to capture, but easier to do if you use a “thin” filter with a size of e.g.&nbsp;<code>1x7</code>. By aggregating information from applying different features, we can extract feature from multi-level at each step.</p>
<p>Of course, adding extra filters increase computation complexity. To remedy this effect, the Inception network proposes to utilise the <code>1x1</code> convolution to reduce the dimensions of feature maps. For example, we want to apply a <code>3x3</code> filter to input ndarray of size <code>[|1; 300; 300; 768|]</code> and the output channel should be <code>320</code>. Instead of applying a convolution layer of <code>[|3; 3; 768; 320|]</code> directly, we first reduce the dimension to, say, 192 by using a small convolution layer <code>[|1; 1; 320; 192|]</code>, and then apply a <code>[|3; 3; 192; 320|]</code> convolution layer to get the final result. By reducing input dimension before the more complex computation with large kernels, the computation complexity is reduced.</p>
<p>Then in a updated version of GoogLeNet, the InceptionV2 (or BN-inception), utilises the “Batch Normalisation” layer. We have seen how normalising input data plays a vital role in improving the efficiency of gradient descent in the Optimisation chapter. Batch normalisation follows a similar path, only at it now works between each layer instead of just at the input data. This layer rescale each mini-batch with the mean and variance of this mini-batch.</p>
<p>Image that we train a network to recognise horse, but most of the training data are actually black or blown horse. Then the network’s performance on white horse might not be quite ideal. This again leads us back to the over-fitting problem. The batch normalisation layer adds noise to input by scaling. As a result, the content at deeper layer is less sensitive to content in lower layers.<br>
Overall, the batch normalisation layer greatly improves the efficiency of training.</p>

<section class="level3" id="factorisation">
<h3>Factorisation</h3>
<p>Now that we understand how the image recognition architectures are developed, finally it’s time to see who these factors are utilised into the InceptionV3 structure.</p>

</div>
<p>Here the <code>conv2d_bn</code> is a basic building block used in this network, consisting of a convolution layer, a normalisation layer, and a relu activation layer. We have already introduced how these different types of layer work. You can think of <code>conv2d_bn</code> as an enhanced convolution layer.</p>
<p>Based on this basic block, the aim in building Inception network is still to go deeper, but here the authors introduces the three type of <em>Inception Modules</em> as a unit of stacking layers. Each module factorise large kernels into smaller ones. Let’s look at them one by one.</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre><code class="language-ocaml">let mix_typ1 in_shape bp_size nn =
  let branch1x1 = conv2d_bn [|1;1;in_shape;64|] [|1;1|] nn in
  let branch5x5 = nn

    |&gt; conv2d_bn [|5;5;48;64|] [|1;1|]

  let branch3x3dbl = nn

    |&gt; conv2d_bn [|3;3;64;96|]  [|1;1|]

  in
  concatenate 3 [|branch1x1; branch5x5; branch3x3dbl; branch_pool|]</code></pre>
</div>
<p>The <code>mix_typ1</code> structure implement the the first type of inception module. In <code>branch3x3dbl</code> branch, it replace a <code>5x5</code> kernel convolution layer with two <code>3x3</code> convolution layers. It follows the design in the VGG network. Of course, as we have explained, both branches uses the <code>1x1</code> to reduce dimensions before complex convolution computation.</p>
<p>In some implementation the <code>3x3</code> convolutions can also be further factorised into <code>3x1</code> and then <code>1x3</code> convolutions. There are more tha one way to do the factorisation. You might be think that it is also a good idea to replace the <code>3x3</code> convolution with two <code>2x2</code>s. Well, we could do that but it saves only about 11% parameters, compared to the 33% save of current practice.</p>
<div class="highlight">

  concatenate 3 [|branch1x1; branch7x7; branch7x7dbl; branch_pool|]</code></pre>
</div>
<p>As shown in the code above, <code>mix_typ4</code> shows the Type B inception module, another basic unit. It still separate into three branches and then concatenate them together. The special about this this type of branch is that it factorise a <code>7x7</code> convolution into the combination of a <code>7x1</code> and then a <code>1x7</code> convolution. Again, this change saves <span class="math inline">\((49 - 14) / 49 = 71.4%\)</span> parameters.</p>
<p>If you have doubt about this replacement, you can do a simple experiment:</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre><code class="language-ocaml">open Neural.S
open Neural.S.Graph

let network_01 =
  input [|28;28;1|]
  |&gt; conv2d ~padding:VALID [|7;7;1;1|] [|1;1|]

let network_02 =

  |&gt; conv2d ~padding:VALID [|1;7;1;1|] [|1;1|]
  |&gt; get_network</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Checking the output log, you can find out that both network give the same output shape. This factorisation is intuitive: convolution of size does not change the output shape at that dimension. Then the two convolutions actually performs feature extraction along each dimension (height and width) respectively.</p>
<div class="highlight">

  concatenate 3 [|branch1x1; branch3x3; branch3x3dbl; branch_pool|]</code></pre>
</div>
<p>The final inception module is a bit more complex, but by now you should be able to understand its construction. It aggregate information from four branches. The <code>1x1</code> convolutions are used to reduce the dimension and computation complexity. Note that in both the <code>branch3x3</code> and <code>branch3x3dbl</code> branches, both <code>3x1</code> and <code>1x3</code> convolutions are used, not as replacement of <code>3x3</code>, but as separate branches. This module is for promoting high dimensional representations.</p>
<p>TODO: explain “promoting high dimensional representations”.</p>
<p>Together, these three modules makes up the core part of the InceptionV3 architecture. By applying different techniques and designs, these modules take less memory and less prone to over-fitting problem. Thus they can be stacked together to make the whole network go deeper.</p>
</section>
<section class="level3" id="grid-size-reduction">
<h3>Grid Size Reduction</h3>
<p>For the very beginning of the design of CNN, we need to reduce the size of feature maps as well as increasing the number or channel of the feature map. We have explained how it is done using the combination of pooling layer and convolution layer. However, the reduction solution constructed this way is either too greedy or two computationally expensive.</p>
<p>Inception architecture proposes a grid size reduction module. It put the same input feature map into to set of pipelines, one of them uses the pooling operation, and the other uses only convolution layers. These two type of layers are then not stacked together but concatenated vertically, as shown in the next part of code.</p>

<p><code>mix_typ8</code> is the second grid size reduction module in the deeper part of the network. It uses three branches instead of two, and each convolution branch is more complex.

<h3>InceptionV3 Architecture</h3>
<p>After introducing the separate units, finally we can construct them together to see what the InceptionV3 network looks like. fig.&nbsp;2 shows the overall architecture of this network (<a href="https://cloud.google.com/tpu/docs/inception-v3-advanced">src</a>):</p>

<p>There is only one last thing we need to mention: the <em>global pooling</em>. Global Average/Max Pooling calculates the average/max output of each feature map in the previous layer. For example, if you have an <code>[|1;10;10;64|]</code> feature map, then this operation can make it to be <code>[|1;1;1;64|]</code>. This operation seems very simple, but it works at the very end of a network, and can be used to replace the fully connection layer. The parameter size of the fully connection layer has always been a problem. Now that it is replaced with a non-trainable operation, the parameter size is greatly reduced without the performance. Besides, the global pooling layer is more robust to spatial translations in the data and mitigate the over-fitting problem in fully connection, accoding to <span data-cites="lin2013network" class="citation">(Lin, Chen, and Yan 2013)</span>.</p>
<p>The full code is listed in <a href="https://gist.github.com/jzstark/9428a62a31dbea75511882ab8218076f">this gist</a>. Even if you are not quite familiar with Owl or OCaml, it must still be quite surprising to see the network that contains 313 neuron nodes can be constructed using only about 150 lines of code. And we are talking about one of the most complex neural networks for computer vision.</p>
<p>Besides InceptionV3, you can also easily construct other popular image recognition networks, such as <a href="https://gist.github.com/pvdhove/a05bf0dbe62361b9c2aff89d26d09ba1">ResNet50</a>, <a href="https://gist.github.com/jzstark/f5409c44d6444921a8ceec00e33c42c4">VGG16</a>, <a href="https://gist.github.com/jzstark/c424e1d1454d58cfb9b0284ba1925a48">SqueezeNet</a> etc. with elegant Owl code.<br>
We have already mentioned most of them in previous sections.</p>

<section class="level2" id="preparing-weights">
<h2>Preparing Weights</h2>
<p>Only building a network structure is not enough. Another important aspect is proper weights of a neural network. It can be achieved by training on GBs of image data for days or longer on powerful machine clusters.</p>
<p>The training is usually done via supervised learning using a large set of labelled images. Although Inception v3 can be trained from many different labelled image sets, ImageNet is a common dataset of choice. ImageNet has over ten million URLs of labelled images. About a million of the images also have bounding boxes specifying a more precise location for the labelled objects. For the Inception model, the ImageNet dataset is composed of 1,331,167 images which are split into training and evaluation datasets containing 1,281,167 and 50,000 images, respectively. (<a href="https://cloud.google.com/tpu/docs/inception-v3-advanced">COPY ALERT</a>) The training of this model can take hundreds of hours of training on multiple high-performance GPUs.</p>
<p>However, not everyone has access to such large resource. Another option is more viable: importing weights from existed pre-trained TensorFlow models, which are currently widely available in model collections such as <a href="https://github.com/fchollet/deep-learning-models/">this one</a>.</p>
<p>The essence of weights is list of ndarrays, which is implemented using <code>Bigarray</code> in OCaml. So the basic idea is to find a intermediate representation so that we can exchange the ndarray in NumPy and <code>Bigarray</code> in OCaml. In our implementation, we choose to use the <a href="https://portal.hdfgroup.org/display/HDF5/HDF5">HDF5</a> as this intermediate data exchange format. In Python, we use the <a href="https://www.h5py.org/">h5py</a> library, and in OCaml we use <a href="https://github.com/vbrankov/hdf5-ocaml">hdf5-ocaml</a>.</p>
<p>The method to save or load hdf5 data files are fixed, but the methods to retrieve data from model files vary depending on the type of original files. For example, if we choose to import weight form a TensorFlow model, we do something like this to achieves the weight data of each layer:</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre><code class="language-python">...
reader = tf.train.NewCheckpointReader(checkpoint_file)
for key in layer_names:
    data=reader.get_tensor(key).tolist()
...</code></pre>
</div>
<p>In a keras, it’s a bit more straightforward:</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre><code class="language-python">...
for layer in model.layers:
    weights = layer.get_weights()
...</code></pre>
</div>
<p>In the OCaml side, we first create a Hashtable and read all the HDF5 key-value pairs into it. Each value is saved as a double precision Owl ndarray.</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre><code class="language-text">...
let h = Hashtbl.create 50 in
let f = H5.open_rdonly h5file  in
for i = 0 to (Array.length layers - 1) do
  let w = H5.read_float_genarray f layers.(i) C_layout in
  Hashtbl.add h layers.(i) (Dense.Ndarray.Generic.cast_d2s w)
done;
...</code></pre>
</div>
<p>And then we can use the mechanism in the Neural Network model to load these values from the hashtable to networks:</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre><code class="language-text">...
let wb = Neuron.mkpar n.neuron in 
Printf.printf "%s\n" n.name; 
wb.(0) &lt;- Neuron.Arr (Hashtbl.find layers n.name);
Neuron.update n.neuron wb
...</code></pre>
</div>
<p>It is very important to make clear the difference in naming of each layer in different platforms, since the creator of the original model may choose any name for each layer. Other differences have also to be taken care of. For example, the <code>beta</code> and <code>gamma</code> weights in the batch normalisation layer is represented as two different values in TensorFlow model, but they belong to the same layer in Owl. Also, some times the dimensions has to be swapped in a ndarray during this weight conversion.</p>
<p>Note that this is one-off work. Once you successfully update the network with weights, the weights can be saved using <code>Graph.save_weights</code>, without haveing to repeat all these steps again. We have already prepared the weights for the InceptionV3 model and other similar models, and the users don’t have to worry about all these trivial model exchanging detail.</p>

<section class="level2" id="image-processing">
<h2>Image Processing</h2>
<p>Image processing is challenging, since OCaml does not provide powerful functions to manipulate images. Though there are image processing libraries such as <a href="http://gallium.inria.fr/camlimages/">CamlImages</a>, but we don’t want to add extra liabilities to Owl itself.</p>
<p>To this end, we choose the non-compressed image format PPM. A PPM file is a 24-bit color image formatted using a text format. It stores each pixel with a number from 0 to 65536, which specifies the color of the pixel. Therefore, we can just use ndarray in Owl and convert that directly to PPM image without using any external libraries. We only need to take care of header information during this process. For example, here is the code for converting an 3-dimensional array in Owl <code>img</code> into a ppm file.</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre><code class="language-ocaml">module N = Dense.Ndarray.S

let save_image_to_file img outname = 
  (* metadata *)
  let shape = N.shape img in
  assert (Array.length(shape) = 3);
  let h = shape.(0) in
  let w = shape.(1) in
  let num_col = 255 in

  (* divide *)
  let r = N.get_slice [[];[];[1]] img in 
  let r = N.reshape r [|h; w|] in
  let g = N.get_slice [[];[];[2]] img  in
  let g = N.reshape g [|h; w|] in
  let b = N.get_slice [[];[];[0]] img in 
  let b = N.reshape b [|h; w|] in

  (* merge r, g, b to one [|h; 3*w|] matrix *)
  let img_mat = Dense.Matrix.S.zeros h (3 * w) in
  Dense.Matrix.S.set_slice [[];[0;-1;3]] img_mat r;
  Dense.Matrix.S.set_slice [[];[1;-1;3]] img_mat g;
  Dense.Matrix.S.set_slice [[];[2;-1;3]] img_mat b;

  (* rotate *)
  let img_mat = Dense.Matrix.S.rotate img_mat 90 in 
  let img_arr = Dense.Matrix.S.to_arrays img_mat in 

  (* change to line *)
  let img_str = Bytes.make (w * h * 3) ' ' in 
  let ww = 3 * w in 
  for i = 0 to ww - 1 do
    for j = 0 to h - 1 do
      let ch = img_arr.(i).(j) |&gt; int_of_float |&gt; char_of_int in
      Bytes.set img_str ((h - 1 -j) * ww + i) ch;
    done
  done;

  let header = "P6\n" ^ string_of_int(h) ^ " " ^ string_of_int(w) ^ "\n" ^ string_of_int(num_col) ^ "\n" in 
  let img_final = Bytes.concat (Bytes.of_string " ") [header |&gt; Bytes.of_string; img_str] in 
  Owl_io.write_file outname (Bytes.to_string img_final)</code></pre>
</div>
<p>In this function we first get the required meta data such as image size, and then combine the three channels of a image (three slices of the input ndarray) into a single line of string by correct order. The finally we construct these information into bytes and then write to the output PPM file.</p>
<p>Similarly, to read an PPM image file into ndarray in Owl, we treat the ppm file line by line with <code>input_line</code> function. The metadata such as version and comments are ignored. We get the metadata such as width and heigh from the header.</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre><code class="language-text">...
let w_h_line = input_line fp in
let w, h = Scanf.sscanf w_h_line "%d %d" (fun w h -&gt; w, h) in
...</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Then according these information, we read the rest of data into a large bytes with <code>Pervasive.really_input</code>. Note that under 32bit OCaml, this will only work when reading strings up to about 16 megabytes.</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre><code class="language-text">...
let img = Bytes.make (w * h * 3) ' ' in
really_input fp img 0 (w * h * 3);
close_in fp;
...</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Then we need to re-arrange the data in the bytes into a matrix.</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre><code class="language-clike">let imf_o = Array.make_matrix (w * 3) h 0.0 in
  
let ww = 3 * w  in
for i = 0 to ww - 1 do
  for j = 0 to h - 1 do
    imf_o.(i).(j) &lt;- float_of_int (int_of_char (Bytes.get img ((h - 1 - j ) * ww + i)));
  done
done;</code></pre>
</div>
<p>This matrix can then be further processed into a ndarray with proper slicing.</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre><code class="language-clike">...
let m = Dense.Matrix.S.of_arrays img in
let m = Dense.Matrix.S.rotate m 270 in
let r = N.get_slice [[];[0;-1;3]] m in
let g = N.get_slice [[];[1;-1;3]] m in
let b = N.get_slice [[];[2;-1;3]] m in
...</code></pre>
</div>
<p>There are other functions such as reading in ndarray from PPM file. The full image processing code can be viewed in <a href="https://gist.github.com/jzstark/86a1748bbc898f2e42538839edba00e1">this gist</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, most of the time we have to deal with image of other more common format such as PNG and JPEG. For the conversion from these format to PPM or the other way around, we use the tool <a href="https://www.imagemagick.org/">ImageMagick</a>.</p>

<h2>Running Inference</h2>
<p>Prepare one image on your computer. It can be of any common image format (jpg, png, gif, etc.) and size. If you’re not sure which image to use, here is one choice we use in the rest of this chapter:</p>
<figure>
<img alt="" style="width:50.0%" id="fig:case-image-inception:panda" src="images/case-image-inception/panda.png"><figcaption>Figure 3: Panda image that is used for image recognition task</figcaption>

<p>Let’s do the image classification with one line of code:</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre><code class="language-clike">owl -run 6dfed11c521fb2cd286f2519fb88d3bf</code></pre>

<p>That’s it. This one-liner is all you need to do to see a image classification example in action. Here is the output (assume using the panda image previously mentioned):</p>
<div class="highlight">

</div>
<p>You need 5 steps to do image classification with InceptionV3:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Import external code/libraries using Zoo in Owl. Using <code>#zoo "gist-id"</code> enables you to use code modules defined in other Gists. Here we want to use <a href="https://gist.github.com/jzstark/9428a62a31dbea75511882ab8218076f">InceptionV3</a> modules. It defines the InceptionV3 network architecture and loads weights of the network. The downloaded code are cached in <code>$HOME/.owl/zoo</code> directory. The InceptionV3 module provides three APIs:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>infer</code>: Service that performs image recognition tasks over client images. It accept a string that specify the location of a local image. Its return value is a 1x1000 N-dimension array, each element is a float number between 0 and 1, indicating the possibility that the image belongs to one of the 1000 classes from ImageNet.</p></li>
<li><p><code>to_json</code>: Convert the inferred result to a raw JSON string. Parameter <code>top</code>: an int value to specify the top-N likeliest labels to return. Default value is 5.</p></li>
<li><p><code>to_json</code>: Convert the inferred result to an array of tuples, each tuple contains label name (“class”, string) and the probability (“prop”, float, between 0 and 1) of target image being in that class.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Load InceptionV3 model with one line of code.</p></li>
<li><p>Designate an absolute path of your input image. Here we use the <code>extend_zoo_path</code> util function to automatically find the “panda.png” image contained in the Gist itself.</p></li>
<li><p>Run inference with the neural network model and the input image, and then decode the result, getting top-N (N defaults to 5) predictions in human-readable format. The output is an array of tuple, each tuple consists of a string for classified type description, and a float number ranging from 0 to 100 to represent the percentage probability of the input image actually being this type.</p></li>
<li><p>If you want, you can pretty-print the result on your screen.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>If you are not interested in installing anything, <a href="http://demo.ocaml.xyz/">here</a> is a web-based demo of this image classification application powered by Owl. Please feel free to play with it! And the server won’t store your image. Actually, if you are so keen to protect your personal data privacy, then you definitely should try to pull the code here and fast build a local image processing service without worrying your images being seen by anybody else!</p>

<section class="level2" id="applications">
<h2>Applications</h2>
<p>Building an image classification application is not the end by itself. It can be used in a wide range of applications. We list some in this section to show how Owl can be deployed in these scenarios.</p>
<p>One of the most popular applications of image recognition that we encounter daily is personal photo organization. Image recognition is empowering the user experience of photo organization apps. Besides offering a photo storage, apps want to go a step further by giving people better search and discovery functions. They can do that with the automated image organization capabilities provided by machine learning. The image recognition API integrated in the apps categorizes images on the basis of identified patterns and groups them thematically. (COPY ALERT)</p>
<p>A powerful commercial use of image recognition can be seen in the field of stock photography and video. Stock websites provide platforms where photographers and videomakers can sell their content. Contributors need a way to tag large amounts of visual material, which is time-consuming and tedious. In the same time, without proper keyword attribution, their content cannot be indexed – and thus cannot be discovered by buyers.<br>
Image recognition is thus crucial for stock websites. (COPY ALERT)</p>
<p>Visual recognition on social media is already a fact. Facebook released its facial recognition app Moments, and has been using facial recognition for tagging people on users’ photos for a while. While face recognition remains a sensitive ground, Facebook hasn’t shied away from integrating it in users’ experience on the social media. Whenever users upload a photo, Facebook is able to recognize objects and scenes in it before people enter a description. The computer vision can distinguish objects, facial expressions, food, natural landscapes and sports, among others. Besides tagging of people on photos, image recognition is used to translate visual content for blind users and to identify inappropriate or offensive images.
