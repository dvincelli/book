(though C is not limited to core op; perhaps move to the system chapter?)

## How to Interface to C

### Categorisation of Operations

### Template 

## Performance Optimisation

### Multi-threading: SIMD 

### Multi-cores: OpenMP

### Other Techniques

for-loop reduction; mutable operations; multiple implementation

## Mix Them Up in Owl

### Example: Math function

### Example: Repeat and Reduction

### Example: Convolution
