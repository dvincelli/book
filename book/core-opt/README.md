# Core Optimisation 

## Why C

Performance; everybody else do that: NumPy, julia

(though C is not limited to core op; perhaps move to the system chapter?)

## How to Interface to C

Using one detailed example to show the top-down way;

Then use a new example to show what if you want to add a new operation, in a bottom-up way.

### Categorisation of Operations

### Template 

## Performance Optimisation

### Multi-threading: SIMD 

### Multi-cores: OpenMP

### Other Techniques

for-loop reduction; mutable operations; multiple implementation

## Cook Good Performance with Ingredients

### Example: Math function

### Example: Repeat and Reduction

### Example: Convolution
