# Natural Language Processing

Text is a dominant media type on the Internet along with images, videos, and audios. Many of our day-to-day tasks involve text analysis. Natural language processing is a powerful tool to extract insights from text copora. 


## Introduction

Survey the literature, give a high-level picture of NLP. Talk about classic NLP ... structured and unstructured text ...

In this chapter, we will use a [news dataset](https://github.com/ryanrhymes/owl_dataset/raw/master/news.txt.gz) crawled from the Internet. It contains 130000 pieces of news from various sources, each line in the file represents one entry.


## Text Corpus

We call a collection of documents a text corpus. 

### Step-by-step Operation

Show how to build a corpus from a collection of documents, in a step step way.

Preprocess the text, convert all the text into lowercase.

```ocaml
let simple_process s =
  Str.split Owl_nlp_utils.regexp_split s
  |> List.filter (fun x -> String.length x > 1)
  |> String.concat " "
  |> String.lowercase_ascii
  |> Bytes.of_string

let preprocess input_file =
  let output_file = input_file ^ ".output" in
  Nlp.Corpus.preprocess simple_process input_file output_file
```

Then let's build vocabulary out of the text corpus.

```ocaml
let build_vocabulary input_file =
  let vocab = Nlp.Vocabulary.build input_file in

  (* print out the words of highest frequency *)
  Nlp.Vocabulary.top vocab 10 |>
  Owl.Utils.Array.to_string ~sep:", " fst;

  (* print out the words of lowest frequency*)
  Nlp.Vocabulary.bottom vocab 10 |>
  Owl.Utils.Array.to_string ~sep:", " fst;

  (* save the vocabulary *)
  let output_file = input_file ^ ".vocab" in 
  Nlp.Vocabulary.save vocab output_file
```

The progress of building the vocabulary is printed out. After the vocabular is built, the token of the highest frequency is printed out.

```text
2020-01-28 20:29:41.592 INFO : processed 13485, avg. 2696 docs/s
2020-01-28 20:29:46.593 INFO : processed 24975, avg. 2497 docs/s
2020-01-28 20:29:51.593 INFO : processed 39728, avg. 2648 docs/s
2020-01-28 20:29:56.595 INFO : processed 53277, avg. 2663 docs/s
2020-01-28 20:30:01.595 INFO : processed 62908, avg. 2516 docs/s
2020-01-28 20:30:06.595 INFO : processed 69924, avg. 2330 docs/s
...
- : string =
"the, to, of, a, and, in, \", s, that, on"
"eichorst, gcs, freeross, depoliticisation, humping, shopable, appurify, intersperse, vyaecheslav, raphaelle"
```

Now let's trim off some most and least frequency words. You can trim either by absolute number or by percent. We use percent here, namely triming off top and bottom 1% of the words.

```ocaml
let trim_vocabulary vocab =
  Nlp.Vocabulary.trim_percent ~lo:0.01 ~hi:0.01 vocab
```

With a vocabulary at hands, now we are ready to tokenise a piece of text.

```ocaml
let tokenise vocab text =
  String.split_on_char ' ' text |> 
  List.map (Nlp.Vocabulary.word2index vocab)
```

For example, if we tokenise "this is owl book", you will get the following output.

```text
tokenise vocab "this is an owl book";;
- : int list = [55756; 18322; 109456; 90661; 22362]
```

Furthermore, we can now tokenise the whole news collection.

```ocaml
(* TODO *)
```



### Use Convenient Function

Show how to build corpus using a convenient function in `Nlp.Corpus`

```ocaml
let main () =
  let corpus = Nlp.Corpus.build "news.txt" in
  Nlp.Corpus.save corpus "news.corpus";
  Nlp.Corpus.print corpus
```

The output is like this ...

```text

```


Show how to further process vocabulary by trim out top and bottom frequency words.


## Vector Space Models

Survey, explain what is VSM, documents become vectors, i.e. a point in high-dimensional space. With VSM, we can cluster the documents based on their proximity, i.e. similarity.


## Bag of Words (BOW)

Explain what is BOW


## Term Frequencyâ€“Inverse Document Frequency (TFIDF)

Explain what is TFIDF, mention Cambridge Wolfson fellow.


## Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)

Explain what is LDA.


## Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA)

Explain what is LSA, and how it differs from LDA wrt to derived topics.


## Indexing and Searching

First implement linear search, then explain random projection and implement a naive version.


## Conclusion

TBD
