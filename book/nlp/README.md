# Natural Language Processing

Text is a dominant media type on the Internet along with images, videos, and audios. Many of our day-to-day tasks involve text analysis. Natural language processing is a powerful tool to extract insights from text copora. 

This chapter focusses on the vector space models and topic modelling.

TODO: this chapter now mainly lacks general text introduction of NLP.


## Introduction

Survey the literature, give a high-level picture of NLP. Talk about classic NLP ... structured and unstructured text ...

In this chapter, we will use a [news dataset](https://github.com/ryanrhymes/owl_dataset/raw/master/news.txt.gz) crawled from the Internet. It contains 130000 pieces of news from various sources, each line in the file represents one entry.


## Text Corpus

We call a collection of documents a text corpus. 

### Step-by-step Operation

Show how to build a corpus from a collection of documents, in a step step way.

Preprocess the text, convert all the text into lowercase.

```ocaml
let simple_process s =
  Str.split Owl_nlp_utils.regexp_split s
  |> List.filter (fun x -> String.length x > 1)
  |> String.concat " "
  |> String.lowercase_ascii
  |> Bytes.of_string

let preprocess input_file =
  let output_file = input_file ^ ".output" in
  Nlp.Corpus.preprocess simple_process input_file output_file
```

Then let's build vocabulary out of the text corpus.

```ocaml
let build_vocabulary input_file =
  let vocab = Nlp.Vocabulary.build input_file in

  (* print out the words of highest frequency *)
  Nlp.Vocabulary.top vocab 10 |>
  Owl.Utils.Array.to_string ~sep:", " fst;

  (* print out the words of lowest frequency*)
  Nlp.Vocabulary.bottom vocab 10 |>
  Owl.Utils.Array.to_string ~sep:", " fst;

  (* save the vocabulary *)
  let output_file = input_file ^ ".vocab" in 
  Nlp.Vocabulary.save vocab output_file
```

The progress of building the vocabulary is printed out. After the vocabular is built, the token of the highest frequency is printed out.

```text
2020-01-28 20:29:41.592 INFO : processed 13485, avg. 2696 docs/s
2020-01-28 20:29:46.593 INFO : processed 24975, avg. 2497 docs/s
2020-01-28 20:29:51.593 INFO : processed 39728, avg. 2648 docs/s
2020-01-28 20:29:56.595 INFO : processed 53277, avg. 2663 docs/s
2020-01-28 20:30:01.595 INFO : processed 62908, avg. 2516 docs/s
2020-01-28 20:30:06.595 INFO : processed 69924, avg. 2330 docs/s
...
- : string =
"the, to, of, a, and, in, \", s, that, on"
"eichorst, gcs, freeross, depoliticisation, humping, shopable, appurify, intersperse, vyaecheslav, raphaelle"
```

Now let's trim off some most and least frequency words. You can trim either by absolute number or by percent. We use percent here, namely triming off top and bottom 1% of the words.

```ocaml
let trim_vocabulary vocab =
  Nlp.Vocabulary.trim_percent ~lo:0.01 ~hi:0.01 vocab
```

With a vocabulary at hands, now we are ready to tokenise a piece of text.

```ocaml
let tokenise vocab text =
  String.split_on_char ' ' text |> 
  List.map (Nlp.Vocabulary.word2index vocab)
```

For example, if we tokenise "this is owl book", you will get the following output.

```text
tokenise vocab "this is an owl book";;
- : int list = [55756; 18322; 109456; 90661; 22362]
```

Furthermore, we can now tokenise the whole news collection.

```ocaml
let tokenise_all vocab input_file =
  let doc_s = Owl_utils.Stack.make () in

  Owl_io.iteri_lines_of_file
    (fun i s ->
      let t =
        Str.split Owl_nlp_utils.regexp_split s
        |> List.filter (Owl_nlp_vocabulary.exits_w vocab)
        |> List.map (Owl_nlp_vocabulary.word2index vocab)
        |> Array.of_list
      in
      Owl_utils.Stack.push doc_s i)
    input_file;

  doc_s
```

Even though this is a simplified case, it well illustrates the typical starting point of text analysis before delving into any topic modelling.


### Use Convenient Function

Show how to build corpus using a convenient function in `Nlp.Corpus`. The convenient function builds the dictionary and tokienise the text corpus at the same time. You can further specify how to trim off the high-frequency and low-frenquency words when calling the function.

```ocaml
let main () =
  (* remove duplicates *)
  let ids = Nlp.Corpus.unique "news.txt" "clean.txt" in
  Printf.printf "removed %i duplicates." (Array.length ids);

  (* build vocabulary and tokenise *)
  let corpus = Nlp.Corpus.build ~lo:0.01 ~hi:0.01 "clean.txt" in
  Nlp.Corpus.save corpus "news.corpus";
  Nlp.Corpus.print corpus
```

The output is like this ...

```text

```

The `save` function will create several files, explain these files ...


### Iterate Documents

Teach how to use `Nlp.Corpus.next` and etc. to iterate and map documents.


## Vector Space Models

Survey, explain what is VSM, documents become vectors, i.e. a point in high-dimensional space. With VSM, we can cluster the documents based on their proximity, i.e. similarity.


## Bag of Words (BOW)

Explain what is BOW, simply counting the frequency. What are the pros and cons of this method?

```ocaml
(* count the term occurrency in a document *)
let term_count htbl doc =
  Array.iter
    (fun w ->
      match Hashtbl.mem htbl w with
      | true  ->
        let a = Hashtbl.find htbl w in
        Hashtbl.replace htbl w (a +. 1.)
      | false -> Hashtbl.add htbl w 1.)
    doc

(* build bag-of-words for the corpus *)
let build_bow corpus =
  Nlp.Corpus.mapi_tok 
    (fun i doc ->
      let htbl = Hashtbl.create 128 in
      term_count htbl;
      htbl)
    corpus
```


## Term Frequencyâ€“Inverse Document Frequency (TFIDF)

Explain what is TFIDF, mention Cambridge Wolfson fellow. The corpus we have built in the previous section is used as input to the following function.

Explain why TFIDF is better than BOW, what is the motivation. Give an examble to illustrate.

```ocaml
let build_tfidf corpus =
  (* configure and build the model *)
  let tf = Nlp.Tfidf.Count in
  let df = Nlp.Tfidf.Idf in
  let model = Nlp.Tfidf.build ~tf ~df corpus in

  (* print and save model *)
  Nlp.Tfidf.print model;
  Nlp.Tfidf.save model "news.tfidf";

  model
```

After the model is build, illustrate how to find k similar documents. The following exmaple uses consine similarity, then convert a document into vector using previously trained TFIDF model. Note do NOT teach how to index and how the similarity is calculted here, teach in Indexing and Searching section.

```ocaml
let query model doc k =
  (* TODO: change api *)
  let typ = Owl_nlp_similarity.Cosine in
  let vec = Nlp.Tfidf.apply model doc in
  let knn = Nlp.Tfidf.nearest ~typ model vec k in
  knn
```


## Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)

Explain what is LDA. `topics` is the number of topics. Owl supports the following types of LDA algorithms.


```ocaml
type lda_typ =
  | SimpleLDA
  | FTreeLDA
  | LightLDA
  | SparseLDA
```

How to train an LDA model.

```text
(* change to ocaml when image progation finished *)
let build_lda corpus topics =
  let model = Nlp.Lda.init ~iter:1000 topics in
  let lda_typ = Nlp.Lda.SparseLDA in
  Nlp.Lda.train lda_typ model;
  Owl.Log.info "LDA training finished."
```


## Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA)

Explain what is LSA, and how it differs from LDA wrt to derived topics.


## Indexing and Searching

Topic models are effective tools for clustering documents based on their similarity or relevance. We can further use this tool to query relevant document given an input one. In this section, we will go through some techniques on how to index and query model built using the previous topic modeling method.

### Euclidean and Consine Similarity

Define what is euclidean and consine similarity. Emphasise both are correlated on a high-dimensional ball model.

TODO: use an image to illustrate.


### Liear Searching

First implement linear search, in this case, we do not need index at all, but it is very slow.

```ocaml
(* TODO *)
```


### Use Matrix Multiplication

Show that pairwise distance can be done in a matrix multiplication, which is often highly-optimised GEMM operation.

```ocaml
(* TODO *)
```


### Random Projection

NOTE: give an image illustration on what is random project, but no need to implement. We will leave this in Recommender System Chapter.
Only give a teaser here which goes like:
"Linear Search does not rely on data structure, but is slow; matrix multiplication is paralleled version LS, faster, but still compute all the pairwise. If you want to simplify computation, you need to use index, and Random Projection is a widely used index method in industry. It is a big topic, and we will cover that in detail in the case chapter."
