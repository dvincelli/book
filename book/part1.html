    <h1>Language Concepts</h1>

    <p>Part I covers the basic language concepts you'll need to
    know when building OCaml programs. It opens up with a guided
    tour to give you a quick overview of the language using an
    interactive command-line interface. The subsequent chapters
    cover the material that is touched upon by the tour in much
    more detail, including detailed coverage of OCaml's approach to
    imperative programming.</p>

    <p>The last few chapters introduce OCaml's powerful abstraction
    facilities. We start by using functors to build a library for
    programming with intervals, and then use first-class modules to
    build a type-safe plugin system. OCaml also supports
    object-oriented programming, and we close Part I with two
    chapters that cover the object system; the first showing how to
    use OCaml's objects directly, and the second showing how to use
    the class system to add more advanced features like
    inheritance. This description comes together in the design of a
    simple object-oriented graphics library.</p>
