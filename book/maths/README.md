# Mathematical Functions

The formula, $y=mx+c$, is displayed inline. Some symbols and equations (such as $\sum{x}$ or $\frac{1}{2}$) are rescaled to prevent disruptions to the regular line spacing. For more voluminous equations (such as $\sum{\frac{(\mu - \bar{x})^2}{n-1}}$), some line spacing disruptions are unavoidable. Math should then be displayed in displayed mode. 

$$\sum{\frac{(\mu - \bar{x})^2}{n-1}}$$

$$\sum \pi \frac{a}{b}$$
