## Contents

- FFT could be introduced in the Signal Processing chapter. Convolution could also be introduced in this part. Note that in Part I there is no need to discuss details about low level optimisation.

- Computation Graph: include Pierre's work; also we could include some of Symbolic's design, such as using graph as IR to convert computation to TPU/GPU.

- Compiler backends: add Mirage.

- Try to reuse existing materials such as Owl paper in the System Architecture section.

- Benchmarking could be added at the end of AEOS. The figures need to be re-drawn with smaller size. 

- Organise existing content on count-sketch, regression, interpolation, root-finding, Orthogonal polynomials, kmeans, svm, etc. Put them into existing chapters for now. 

- Algorithmic Differentiation: require Calvin's help


## Notes

- The difference between Part I and II: the first is about teaching users to solve problems, and the second is about how the first part is designed and implemented.

- Currently there is no length limit for each chapter; add as much as possible.

- Add URL link wherever required; they can be removed in a printed book. 

- Add as much function documentation as possible. They can be reduced or removed later.

- Every chapter should have a broadly similar style, such as that they all need to have an introduction and conclusion section. 

- NN: do not rely on existing demo; we are not yet-another-book bout NN.
