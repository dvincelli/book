## Contents

- FFT could be introduced in the Signal Processing chapter. Convolution could also be introduced in this part. Note that in Part I there is no need to discuss details about low level optimisation.

- Computation Graph: include Pierre's work; also we could include some of Symbolic's design, such as using graph as IR to convert computation to TPU/GPU.

- Compiler backends: add Mirage.

- Try to reuse existing materials such as Owl paper in the System Architecture section.

- Benchmarking could be added at the end of AEOS. The figures need to be re-drawn with smaller size. 

- Organise existing content on count-sketch, regression, interpolation, root-finding, Orthogonal polynomials, kmeans, svm, etc. Put them into existing chapters for now. 

- Algorithmic Differentiation: require Calvin's help

- Our content should be between that of scientific computation and data science.

- Pay attention to topics that multiple book cover; perhaps we should also include them.

- We don't have to, or better not to, strictly process chapter by chapter. Dump contents and discuss examples for now. It's OK to leave a note that says "a reference/exmaple should be here".

- No need to change the content now following the other books; but just keep in mind what a publishable structure should look like, and later we can re-arrange the order of contents.


## Notes

- Plotting is no big issue. 

- A lot of things could go wrong, e.g. required functions not implemented yet. Find out these issues as early as possible. 

- The difference between Part I and II: the first is about teaching users to solve problems, and the second is about how the first part is designed and implemented.

- Currently there is no length limit for each chapter; add as much as possible.

- Add URL link wherever required; they can be removed in a printed book. 

- Add as much function documentation as possible. They can be reduced or removed later.

- Every chapter should have a broadly similar style, such as that they all need to have an introduction and conclusion section. 

- NN: do not rely on existing demo; we are not yet-another-book bout NN. 


## Timeline

[Timeline table](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Wk1CUsJ257cPKCwxaenRpFB-SiHLn4dmO8a_wpnbsPw/edit?usp=sharing)

The timeline table defines the estimated progress using milestones and expected finishing time. 
Our time is very limited. Pushing 5% a week should merely suffice for the very first stage.
