Pygments style sheets were generated by running:

```
pygmentize -S <style> -f html -a "pre" > _pygments-<style>.scss
```

where <style> is any of the styles listed in `all.txt`.

The exception is `solarized-dark` and `solarized-light`, which are not
provided by pygments. As noted in their headers, these files were
obtained [here](https://gist.github.com/nicolashery/5765395).

Variations of the above styles are suffixed with 2, 3, etc.
